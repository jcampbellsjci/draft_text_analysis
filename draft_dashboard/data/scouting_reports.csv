Kyrie Irving,":  A “true” PG with a great feel for the game … Charismatic player with the imagination and mindset to become a standout PG at the NBA level , “has a chance to be special”… A facilitator who shows the ability to make those around him better … Great vision and passing skills … Great burst. Has the blow by speed to get past defenders off the dribble … Good decision maker. Looks to make the right play instead of always trying to dazzle … Doesn’t force shots or overdribble (improved this in his limited time at Duke) … Excellent shooter with the ability to get shots within the flow of the offense …  Jumpshot has great form … Has range out to NBA three and just needs time to gain consistency on it … Good one on one skills … Can pull up off the dribble … A strong finisher exhibiting good body control … Ambidextrous with the dribble, showing impressive ability to go to the left and finish with his off hand … Has excellent ball handling ability with a nasty crossover … High motor kid who gets strong reviews for his character and work ethic … Has a good wingspan and big hands which are obviously positive attributes … Very efficient shooter : 53% fg, 90% ft, 45% 3p … Solid defender with adequate size. Gets low, fundamental, doesn’t gamble too often. Plays the passing lanes well (1.5 spg) …  ",":  Durability is a legitimate concern after he missed all but 8 games of his freshman season (heading into the post season)  …  The big question is whether this was a fluke (turftoe injury) or indicative of a bigger problem … Lack of experience at the college level  is concerning considering how difficult it is to master the position at the next level … Could struggle with the transition to the NBA game with just 8 games of NCAA experience under his belt. Granted he looked advanced for a freshmen PG … Has solid athleticism, but not elite … Not known for highlight reel dunks or a player who overwhelms opponents with his physicality … Needs to continue to work on his strength in order to improve his ability to finish and defensively … Tendency to get out of control attacking the basket … Put up tremendous numbers in his first 8 games, however it’s questionable he would have sustained that for an entire season through conference play … Appears to have the total package but missing such a huge portion of his freshman season makes him a risk. A team will have to roll the dice on limited college experience and exposure … ",6-3,191,PG,Duke,Fr.,2011
Derrick Williams,": Williams’ production in his 2 years at Arizona were phenomenal, as he managed to improve on his excellent Fr. stats across the board … In terms of physical tools, Williams has very good size for a combo forward, boasting a very strong 6’9 248 lb frame with a long 7’1 wingspan added for good measure … Very fluid and smooth athlete, who also flashes explosiveness leaping off of 2 feet … A true matchup problem for defenders, Williams uses his strong footwork and soft touch to score the ball with very good effectiveness in the post or facing up … His shooting ability is good, as evidenced by his 57% 3-point percentage (albeit on a limited 2 attempts a night), and he uses it to keep his matchup honest so they can’t play off of him … Also functional from mid-range, as a threat to slash or shoot … One of the best isolation players in the entire draft, as PF’s have big trouble with his rangy first step and body control for a guy his size, and SFs are generally at a disadvantage in terms of their size and strength … Has an ease at which he creates shots from the PF spot that will continue to make him a big threat from that position, and his size is certainly adequate enough to play down low too … Fairly decisive finisher down low, who uses his wide lower body to seal in good position to get the pass and go up with shots before the defense collapses on him … Works hard moving without the ball, and isn’t indifferent to throwing his body in his man down low to establish very deep position … Although he’s not likely to seal NBA PF’s as much as he did in college, he also can post from mid-range and utilize quick spins and turnaround moves to use his dribble drive game to his advantage … Understands how to shield defenders using his body off the dribble … Strong finisher, who will at times slip free of the D around the rim and make emphatic dunks as a 2 footed leaper … Very capable finisher with both hands … Pretty easy shooting stroke with a soft touch and compact fundamentals that are very consistent … Pretty good offensive rebounder due to his quick 2nd bounce and solid motor, and will get high percentage shots every game due to this … Won’t take very many bad shots, which is a great sign due to the go-to role he embraced for 2 years … Got to the foul line a lot due to his ability to be a mismatch, shot an OK percentage (74%) once there, and this aspect of his game will very likely translate to the NBA as well … Super efficient, and scored 19.5 ppg on just 10 FG attempts a game … Ability to develop from a fairly unheralded recruit, to a surprisingly productive Fr., then to improve on a great Fr. season across the board as a Soph. speaks to his work ethic, and he still can make improvements on his weaknesses right now to continue to grow … Showed the ability to step up in big situations with kep plays to win games …  ",": Considered a combo forward, and there are some questions about what position he will defend with the most effectiveness … Insists that he sees himself as a SF more than a PF, but he has never really played SF dating back to HS, and would certainly be a shaky defender against NBA SF’s … Hard to see him being as efficient and effective if he plays more SF than PF, although he certainly will be able to play some legit time on the wing … Was a pretty modest defensive player in college, as his lateral quickness is mediocre and his length is just OK, which are respective problems for the SF and PF positions … Definitely has wavering intensity on this end, and will allow baskets without much resistance around the rim, particularly against the bigger, more athletic PF’s he faced … Wasn’t that great a defensive rebounder (5.5 a game) and will ball-watch, and gives up rebounds on the defensive end that give offenses 2nd chance opportunities at times … Although he generally is decisive, Williams struggles at times with defenders crowding him and is pretty turnover prone when he gets collapsed upon … Doesn’t look to pass the ball very much … Saw limited minutes at times in games due to foul trouble … Won’t be a big threat in the passing lanes or blocking shots at the NBA level … ",6-8,248,SF/PF,Arizona,So.,2011
Enes Kanter,": Bigman with excellent size, strength and polish … Combines brute strength with a high skill level … Soft hands … Long arms and solid athleticism allow him to be a force in the paint … A tremendous rebounder. Plays with a high motor and enjoys contact … Has a strong frame and a high basketball IQ … Has a scorers mentality. Owns a diverse offensive game with the ability to use post moves and strength to score on his opponent or face the basket and knock down mind-range jumpshots … Has the strength to muscle through contact and finish … Smooth offensive game. Has a soft touch and excellent shooting motion … Good free throw shooter … Has legitimate center size. Measured 6-11, 261 lbs at the LeBron James Skills Academy in July … Possesses great dexterity and body control for a bigman … Coachable kid with a positive attitude and strong work ethic …  ",": One of the big concerns scouts have with Kanter is his physical health. He has had a history of knee problems and there are concerns about his knees not checking out 100% when he has NBA physicals … Foot speed is good but not at the level of some of the top inside forces in the NBA … Played one year of high school ball at Stoneridge Prep in Simi Valley, California and was somewhat inconsistent …  ",6-11,259,PF/C,Kentucky,Fr.,2011
Jonas Valanciunas,": Lithuanian bigman with great size and rebounding instincts … Has a long 6’11"" frame and a huge wingspan to go along with it … Very fluid athlete … Runs the court well for a center … Good quickness and solid explosiveness/leaping ability … Strength/weight has been improving, and he should continue to add more in the future … Uses all of his physical skills to the fullest when attacking the glass … Extremely aggressive rebounder both offensively and defensively … Gets a lot of tip-ins and put-backs … Shows a good understanding of boxing out, which is somewhat rare for young players … Uses great length to either grab or tip out-of-area rebounds to teammates … Solid shot blocker with the potential to be very good in this area … Competes hard on defense … Length allows him to contest entry passes … Super active on both ends of the court … In the paint he shows a variety of developing moves … Has a nice jump-shot from 8-12 feet away from the hoop … Has great shooting mechanics and an extraordinarily soft touch for a bigman … Has a developing hook shot that could be deadly in time … Often used in pick and roll situations … Favorite move is to ""slip"" after setting up for a pick, and cut to the rim … Keeps the ball high and away from any secondary defenders … Incredibly efficient (shot 70.8% from the field in the Euroleague) … Doesn’t miss a lot of shots because he operates so close to the rim … If he doesn’t have a high-percentage shot he immediately passes the ball out … Remarkable free-throw shooter (88.5%) … Tough player that’s not afraid of contact … Just turned 19 and has a great deal of potential … Has a lot of enthusiasm for the game, and eager to improve. Unlike a lot of bigmen that were pushed into the game of basketball, it’s obvious he has a genuine love for the game …  ",":  Can’t create his own offense yet … Has a budding set of skills in the post, but needs teammates who can set him up … No real perimeter game … Almost all offense comes from around the hoop … Very unselfish but not a talented passer … Makes a lot of mistakes when trying to pass out of double teams … Plays very aggressively, which is a good quality, but it gets him in foul trouble quickly … Needs to learn how to play good defense without fouling … Hasn’t developed the habit of remaining stationary when setting screens … Struggles guarding stronger players … Still skinny, though he is showing progress in this area … Is currently signed with Lietuvos Rytas and the buyout option in his contract is over $3 million dollars, so he may not see the NBA for a few seasons … Very wet behind the ears.  ",6-11,240,C,Lithuania,Intl.,2011
Brandon Knight,": Heady point guard with great size and explosive scoring ability … Very natural scorer with an effortless shooting ability and excellent instincts off the dribble … Very quick in half-court situations … Great first step … Penetrates the defense and gets into the paint with ease … Possesses a good-looking runner, which can be extremely useful for point guards at the next level … A fast runner in the open court … Makes good decisions in fast-break opportunities … Great size for a point guard, standing 6’3.25"" in shoes with a 6’6.75"" wingspan … Uses his length and solid athleticism to finish well around the rim … Looks comfortable with the ball in his hands … Creates shots well for himself … Uses a lot of hesitations and fakes to get himself open … Shoots the ball often and with confidence … Already has NBA three-point range … Likes to surprise the defense with a quick pull-up jumper just inside the arc … Doesn’t get rattled easily … Thrives in high-pressure situations … Had a reputation for being a clutch performer in high school and has certainly lived up to that at Kentucky (game-winners against Princeton and Ohio State in the NCAA tournament) … Unselfish passer who looks to keep his teammates involved … Good timing in pick and roll situations … Very smart defender that doesn’t gamble for steals a lot … Has the quick feet and long arms to stay in front of his man and deny penetration … Highly competitive and mature … Had a 4.0 GPA at Kentucky, which suggests that he is also responsible off the court … Only 19 years old with a strong work-ethic and a high upside … Will continue to improve … ",": Not a pure point guard … Ball handling ability needs a lot of work. His dribble is too high and will be easy to pick unless he improves upon it … Passing ability is respectable, but not intuitive … Very turnover prone, especially when trying to create for others … Gets caught trying to make ""home run"" passes at times, when a more conservative approach would save his team the possession… Efficiency leaves something to be desired … Only shot 42.3% from the floor… Very streaky shooter … Takes ill-advised shots, which aren’t really a problem when he’s hot, but can make you scratch your head if he wasn’t having a good game to begin with… Athletically, his leaping ability is fairly average… Isn’t a real threat to explode vertically or dunk on the defense … At 177 lbs, he’ll get pushed around by the stronger guards in the NBA … ",6-3,177,PG/SG,Kentucky,Fr.,2011
Jan Vesely,": Possesses a terrific combination of size and length for the SF position … Offensively, he improved his low post game and is looking to post up more this year; he can post up smaller defenders and uses his height advantage to score over defenders; has a height/length advantage on almost every player in Europe … Jan has good motor and excellent ability to run the floor (most of his points are off of dunks, put-backs and points in transition) … Good hands around the basket … Facing up to the basket, he is able to get to the rim quickly due to his quickness and good first step. Very explosive off the floor when attacking the bucket and finishes strong … As a shooter he improved since last year and feels more confident taking shots outside the 3pt line and creating off the dribble; his mechanics and follow-through look fluid; good elevation on his shot … If he catches the ball and his feet are set and pointed towards the basket he usually will knock down shots … Defensively he is good, thanks to his length and can guard multiple positions … His lateral quickness is impressive for his size and he does a solid job at moving his feet (good P&R defender and closes well on the perimeter staying in front of guards) … Plays with lot of emotion … A competitive player that hustles for loose balls and brings energy on the court … ",": Vesely needs to continue improving his offensive skills. He’s still a work in progress as a player as his athleticism and ""wow plays"" exceed his effectiveness and consistency … He has had a decent season but more was expected from him coming into the year … He is limited to one or two dribbles when creating off the dribble and needs to improve his 1-on-1 game and ball-handling skills … Has to become more efficient/consistent shooter overall (50% FG, 46% FT, 46.3% 3FG in Euroleague and 74.1 % FG, 51% FT, 31.8% 3FG in NLB League) … Hasn’t added any weight since last year and will have to get stronger in order to compete in the NBA; still has trouble finishing plays under pressure … Has strength and athleticism but not productive enough as a rebounder (4.4 rpg in NLB League and only 2.9 rpg in Euroleague) … Could run into some problems fitting into an NBA position as his length slows him some on the perimeter in the half court set and he lacks the strength and toughness to play in the paint right now … Stevan Petrovic 1/31/11 Strengths: One of the most intriguing international prospects … At 6’11, he is not only comfortable shooting the ball from deep (with nice form and a smooth release), but he is more than capable of handling it in transition and running the fast break … He is a very active, energy type player who plays extremely hard and rarely takes plays off … A great motor to go along with good hands and feet, allows him to play a variety of positions on the floor … Shows potential to become a full time player on the perimeter, he is capable of putting the ball on the floor and attacking the basket … Has the explosiveness to get by the defender and to finish above the rim in traffic … He is a good slasher and he moves extremely well without the ball, either using screens or cuts to get into scoring positions … He is a very good rebounder, showing good instincts and willingness to attack the glass … For a young player of his size, his passing ability might be the most surprising, he can find teammates with pinpoint passes and he can also do it off the dribble … Defensively, his length and athleticism allow him to block and alter many shots as well as get into the passing lanes … The experience that he is getting playing during key moments on the biggest European stage has done wonders to both his development and maturation … Not many 18 year olds are put in a position where they are expected to contribute on a nightly basis, but he has been asked exactly that and has performed… ",6-11,230,SF/PF,Czech Republic,Intl.,2011
Tristan Thompson,": A lefty post player with a tremendous wingspan … He has made improvements to his body, shedding the baby fat he carried throughout high-school, he has also added some mass and definition (his frame shows the potential to support even more weight without taking away from his explosiveness) … A good athlete, he is able to make plays on both ends of the floor thanks to his length, energy and blue collar approach… He establishes good early position and gets a high number of easy looks in transition thanks to his ability to run the floor … Battles for position and is able to get touches very close to the basket because he seals and counterseals extremely well … Has very good hands and makes difficult catches in traffic and on the move … Shows the ability to turn to both shoulders effectively and can finish with mini jump hooks with both hands  … He is becoming more comfortable using his body and quick feet to beat defenders to the spot …  He flashes the ability to faceup and attack off the bounce, but he will need to continue to polish his handles before he can fully utilize his quick and long first step … Finds the seams in the defence and gets to the openings for quick and easy finishes without having plays run for him … When his energy level is high he can be a very good rebounder, especially on the offensive end … He has an extremely quick second jump, and he is able to time his attack and get his hands on a high percentage of missed shots … His length also posses problems on the defensive end, as he is able to recover quickly or slide over from the weakside to block and contest shots around the basket …  ",": At 6-9 he is a bit on the short side as a power forward at the next level … Although he has terrific length, and good athleticism, they do not negate his size issues completely … Also, at this point in his career he plays more as a center as his game is strictly confined to the low block … The major inadequacy that limits his game to the paint is the fact that his jumper needs serious work … He showed very little confidence in it all year and the ones he did take looked hesitant and were off-balance (he shoots with a major fade on almost every shot) … He shoots the ball over his head and extends the release too high, making his stroke very erratic and the results extremely inconsistent… To compound the issue, he shot an abysmal 49% from the foul line, raising the concern level on his outside touch even more … He needs to improve his back to the basket repertoire, adding counter moves once his initial drive gets cut off would benefit his game … Struggles against stronger defenders, can be bodied out of position and into off-balance shots … He is an inconsistent performer, his energy fluctuates drastically from game to game, and he doesn’t play with the same drive every night … Has disappeared in some big games this season … There is a strong correlation between his scoring and rebounding numbers, if he doesn’t get touches early in the game he will not look to get to the glass with the same aggressiveness on either end …  Born in 1991, he is a full year older than his class … Borko Popic 4/26/11    SEASON   TEAM   MIN   PTS   REB   AST   TO   A/T   STL   BLK   PF   FG%   FT%   3P%   PPS  2010-2011 Texas 30.9 13.1 7.8 1.3 1.8 0.70 0.9 2.4 2.8 0.546 0.487 0.000 1.50 Per Game Texas 30.9 13.1 7.8 1.3 1.8 0.70 0.9 2.4 2.8 0.546 0.487 0.000 1.50    SEASON   TEAM   GP   MIN   FG   FGA   FTM   FTA   3PM   3PA   PTS   OFF   DEF   TOT   AST   TO   STL   BLK   PF  2010-2011 Texas 36 1114 172 315 127 261     471 138 144 282 45 64 34 86 100 Totals Texas 36 1114 172 315 127 261     471 138 144 282 45 64 34 86 100    YouTube Clip – 10/3/2008     ",6-9,227,PF,Texas,Fr.,2011
Bismack Biyombo,": A very explosive 6’9” center with a terrific wingspan … He’s able to run the floor with very good speed and hustles at all times … As he gains experience, his skills will certainly permit him to become a very solid defensive player, possibly a shot blocking specialist … Quickness and footspeed are surely good enough to defend inside players, hedge and recuperate on the pick and roll … Toughness and intensity are fine, balance is okay too, although as he gets stronger and adds volume it’ll be easier for him to hold inside positions and become a better finisher in the paint. Biyombo is a player who likes to play above the rim. Additionally he has nice skills in the low post to attack the basket, using fakes, spin moves and jump hooks … A quick first step and ability to put the ball on the floor allow him also to make one dribble power moves to the basket .. Appears to be a quick study, developing his skill level to the point where it is … There have been numerous African players who have been brought to European leagues and failed to accomplish what Biyombo has (impacting a high level ACB team) … As for rebounding, Bismack usually tries to box out and goes for offensive boards quite fiercely … In just a few months playing with the first team of Fuenlabrada in the ACB, defensive positioning in help side has improved a lot to become a consistent intimidating force in the paint … considered a high character kid by all accounts … Hands aren’t bad considering how raw he is and that many African players have below average hand eye coordination, and he could even develop into a pick and roll option.  ",": Offensive game is a long ways from being NBA ready … He still needs to develop his footwork and overall awareness … Doesn’t have the needed confidence in his left hand yet and has to go right to finish inside. His outside shooting lacks polish … Right now his passing is only average … His general basketball knowledge and awareness on both sides of the court show his lack of experience … Fundamentals and timing on rebounds can improve … Several relatively basic concepts in both offense and defense aren’t yet automatic in his game … Too often loses rebounds by jumping in an uncontrolled fashion for blocked shots instead of keeping his inside position to box out his opponent …  Nico Van den Bogaerd 6/12/11  Strengths: A bigtime shot blocker with tremendous length (7-7 wingspan) and athleticism for a bigman. Intimidating force on the defensive end … Protects the rim well and shows excellent timing and reflexes on blocked shots … Runs the floor very fast. Plays with a high motor, brings energy to the team defensively … Has made an impact at the senior level in Europe playing in Spain (17 min, 6.4 ppg and 5 rpg, 2.3 blk) in a short amount of time … Thick, strong legs. Powerful frame. Already has an NBA body … Hustles for rebounds … Shows a mature, positive attitude. Speaks English well … His offensive rebounding and put backs are currently his most effective offensive weapon …  ",6-9,243,C,Congo,Intl.,2011
Kawhi Leonard,": A hybrid forward with terrific length … He has a high motor and plays the game with a lot of energy … Spends majority of the time on the perimeter, but occasionally shows the ability to play with his back to the basket … Uses an effective turnaround jumper inside when posting up … An agile athlete, his strides are extremely long and he covers a lot of space when running the floor … Shows improvement in majority of areas from freshman to sophomore seasons … His shooting has improved and he has become a respectable threat from the outside … Operating out of the triple threat, he combines a nice jab with a fairly quick and long first step to create separation … He has a strong preference going to his pull-up jumper, and once he gets into a rhythm he can string a number makes together (his length and high release make it a difficult shot to contest) … He is fairly comfortable handling the ball in the open court and is capable of pushing it out off the rebound when the situation calls for it … Even with the improvements to his offensive game, he still continues to contribute heavily in the rebounding department … His huge hangs, length, energy and great timing, allow him to snatch balls on both ends that are well outside of his rebounding area … An extremely quick jumper, he is very good at tipping the ball and keeping it alive on the rim … Has the instincts and shows potential in becoming a very solid defender … His ability to get out in the passing lanes and also contest shots inside make him a very dangerous weapon on the defensive end … ",": Does not have one aspect offensively that stands out or which allows him to consistently score the ball … With his size and frame, will almost certainly be a perimeter player at the next level, but he lacks the polish and skill necessary to consistently operate on the wing … He does not have break down ability off the dribble and he is especially shaky handling the ball with his left hand …  His jumpshot (while definitely improved) is still very inconsistent … The release comes high off his head and it is somewhat of a sling motion, which results in a fairly flat shot that goes all over the place … At this level, he has a size advantage on almost a nightly basis, but he still chooses to take the majority of his shots from the outside … Takes a high number of off balance shots, but does not show the ability to convert them at a good percentage … He does not have a great touch around the basket, and unless he can get inside position on the defense, he struggles finishing when contested … Not very disciplined defensively, he gambles far too often and leaves his team susceptible to giving up easy baskets … Borko Popic 2/1/11      SEASON   TEAM   MIN   PTS   REB   AST   TO   A/T   STL   BLK   PF   FG%   FT%   3P%   PPS  2009-10 SDState 31.3 12.7 9.9 1.9 2.3 0.84 1.4 0.7 2.5 0.455 0.726 0.205 1.19 2010-11 SDState 32.6 15.5 10.6 2.5 2.1 1.20 1.4 0.6 2.5 0.444 0.759 0.291 1.17 PerGame   31.9 14.1 10.2 2.2 2.2 1.02 1.48 0.6 2.5 0.449 0.744 0.250 1.18      SEASON   TEAM   GP   MIN   FG   FGA   FTM   FTA   3PM   3PA   PTS   OFF   DEF   TOT   AST   TO   STL   BLK   PF  2009-10 SDState 34 1064 166 365 85 117 16 78 433 119 217 336 65 77 47 24 85 2010-11 SDState 36 1172 211 475 110 145 25 86 557 111 269 380 91 76 51 21 89 Totals   70 2236 377 840 195 262 41 164 990 230 486 716 156 153 98 45 174       ",6-7,227,SF,San Diego St.,So.,2011
Jimmer Fredette,": An absolutely relentless scorer … Led nation in points per game with 28.9 … Wide array of ways to put the ball in the basket … Great size and strength for a point guard … Strong finisher around the rim … Uncanny shooting ability … Volume shooter that maintains efficiency; averaged 3.3 three-pointers made per game in his senior season on 39.6% … Gets an outstanding amount of elevation on his jump shot … Won’t dazzle with high-flying dunks, but uses the athleticism he has very well … Tough to stop in transition … Can pull-up for a quick jump shot from anywhere on the court … Unlimited range … Supreme confidence in his shooting ability, won’t hesitate to fire from as far as 30 feet away from the basket … Able to make shots even when appearing well off-balance … Great free-throw shooter (89.4%) … Underrated quickness … Nasty ball-handling ability … Deadly crossover … Frequently throws off defenders with well-timed hesitations moves off the dribble … Can create a lot of space for himself, with or without the ball … Doesn’t have to dominate the ball to be effective … Crafty mid-range game … Comes off screens extremely well … Automatic catch-and-shoot ability … Talented passer that has the ability to create open shots for his teammates … Thrives in high-pressure situations … Very unselfish … Very high basketball IQ … Tough, physical player that doesn’t shy away from contact … Gym rat, always focused on improving his game … Smart, well-spoken kid that always seems to impress in his interviews … ",": A very poor defender at BYU …  His team couldn’t afford for him to get in foul trouble which may account for his lackluster defensive effort … Struggles to close out on shooters … As the primary offensive option on his team, he hasn’t proven he can be a pass-first point guard … Assist-to-turnover ratio is poor (4.3 assists to 3.5 turnovers), but understandable due to his role on the team … Prone to getting blocked on his drives to the rim … Athleticism is certainly below average for an NBA point guard, which may hinder his ability to get his shot off at the next level … ",6-2,196,PG,,Sr.,2011
Klay Thompson,": One of the top pure shooters on the college level … Prolific outside shooter with a defined role for the NBA level … Right hander who at 6’6 with long arms has good size for the NBA 2-guard position … Shows an excellent feel having been around the game his entire life. Understands his limitations and plays within his game well … Plays well off the ball. Stays active. Works hard to create scoring opportunities. Understands how to create shots for himself off the ball coming off screens … Very good spot up shooter … Comfortable handling the ball and can use the dribble to create shots … Can use his left hand effectively … Shows an advanced in between game with tear drops and the use of the glass … Effectively uses pump fakes to draw defenders off balance … Has perfect form on his shot and deep range. Squares to the basket. Quick, concise, fluid stroke with a high release … Gets his shot off quickly and can do so without needing much space … Exhibits prudent shot selection … Large wingspan allows him to play more athletic than he appears. Can dunk on his defenders if he catches opponents napping … Solid decision maker with a positive a/to ratio … 1.6 steals per game as a senior showed his progression as a defender / anticipation … Extremely level headed, doesn’t show a great deal of emotion or get rattled easily …  ",": An average athlete who plays below the rim … He’s a ""momentum athlete"" in the sense that he shows solid athleticism when he has momentum moving towards the rim … Much better in the half court than in the open floor. His lack of elite athleticism gets exposed in the transition game … Lacks great foot speed which inhibits his ability to take the ball off the dribble against quick defenders … Recevied a one game suspension due to a marijuana possession charge, but scouts don’t seem too concerned about that therefore it hasn’t affected his stock much … Long, athletic defenders can give him trouble …  ",6-7,206,SG/SF,Washington St...,Jr.,2011
Kemba Walker,": Walker’s game is marked by ""electricity"" and explosiveness. Plays with an undefinable burst, seemingly moving in warp speed while everyone else is standing still- yet he remains for the most part under control, with the ball on a string. Working in his favor is a freakish blend of raw speed, breathtaking quickness, ultra-aggression and sneaky power. Scores from anywhere on the court (23.5 ppg). Can’t be contained by a single defender off the dribble, be it in the half court or most notably in transition. Splits double teams and traps in a blink. Changes direction at FULL speed. He is a master at creating space, using jab steps, cross overs and pump fakes to shed defenders. Highly creative with the rock in his hands and finishing at the rim. Able to complete plays through contact with a full head of steam. Also able to re-adjust angles and avoid shot blockers by hanging and improvising in mid-air. Constantly in attack mode, frequently living at the charity stripe (7.7 attempts). Scoop shots and floaters are not foreign to his arsenal either. Overall shooting aptitude has improved dramatically since arriving on campus. His range shooting is now a real weapon (33% on 5.5 attempts), despite a myriad of low percentage, bail out chucks. He’s always been extremely comfortable shooting step back J’s off the dribble, but displayed a new wrinkle coming off screens as the season progressed. Solid elevation and high release. Tremendous two-footed leaper in space. Despite his gift for the putting the ball in the bucket, he’s very much a facilitator (4.5 apg), creating open shots for others by commanding a second/third defender. Prolific rebounder for his size (5.4 rpg), completely unafraid to mix it up with bigger bodies. Excellent lateral quickness with fluid hips. Beats the offensive player to the spot. Opportunistic defensively- if you’re careless with the ball, he’ll take it back the other way for a deuce (1.9 stl). His motor never runs low (38 minutes per). A true winner with a warrior’s spirit.   ",": His measurement of 6’1 with shoes was a win, but he remains an undersized commodity, his standing reach of 7’7.5 is the same as 5’10 PG Isaiah Thomas. Defending the new breed of NBA point guards will be a severe challenge. He takes a ton of hits in his 184-pound frame, and while he’s been anything but fragile, it’s a concern over the long haul. Walker’s an unselfish distributor and a dynamic playmaker, but he’ll never be mistaken for an orchestrator or true lead guard. Connecticut’s half court offense was largely late clock isolations: can he get a team organized and operate an NBA style, functional system? Has a tendency to play out of control times, but to his credit he has learned to pace himself when the situation calls for it (2.3 turnovers). It’s difficult to cage a lion, and as a result he will go through patches where he gets caught up in the emotion of the game. Too many out of control shot attempts, attacking the trees wildly when there’s simply nothing available. Fearless is a great quality as long as it doesn’t reach the point of reckless. Criticizing him for lack of efficiency (43% fg) is probably unfair given the tremendous burden placed upon his shoulders. Nevertheless, he does have a tendency to waste possessions. He finished in traffic at the collegiate level, but the NBA paint is a different animal. Continued advancement in the mid-range, pull up game will go a long ways in getting more quality looks and saving his body. Shooting stroke needs fine tuning, particularly from range. Arc on his jumper brings rain and inhibits consistent results. Adam Ganeles 5/24/11 Strengths: A point guard with amazing speed, his quickness and ability to change direction make him the player he is … Slick with the ball in his hands, Walker has great potential if he’s able to fix a few flaws in his game … His shot isn’t fully there yet, however it improved dramatically from his freshman year to his sophomore year … He’s become a better spot up shooter, and his pull-up jumper off the dribble is what will propel him to become and effective guard at the next level …  Doesn’t have consistent range yet, but he has a smooth and fluent motion, leaving the door open to hitting 3 pointers in the NBA … Has a good feel for the pick and roll, an important quality to be successful in the pros … He’s very effective getting into the paint, which not only opens up opportunities for himself, but his teammates as well … For his size (5’11), he finishes pretty well around the rim … He’s explosive, and has a quick first step … His aggressive nature enables him to shoot 6 free throws per game … He has above average vision with the ball, showing the ability to hit the open man, open up the floor, or thread the needle … Defensively, he plays in your face on the perimeter, and his quickness allows him to keep his man in front of him … His athletic ability and defensive awareness get him 2 steals, which illustrate his ability to read passing lanes … ",6-1,184,PG,UConn,Jr.,2011
Alec Burks,": Burks has NBA shooting guard size at 6’6 with an excellent 6’10 wingspan, and even shows some point guard abilities … An advanced ball-handler who can get to the rim in traffic using either hand… Uses his athleticism and feel for the rim to finish in the paint… Has excellent scoring instincts and really knows how to create his own shot … Possesses a rhythmic bounce to his step that allows him to pullup off the hesitation dribble … 82% free throw shooting on 7.9 free throw attempts per game …  Excels in the open court, where he uses long strides and his athletic ability to convert on fast break opportunities … His versatility allows him to play both as a slasher off the ball, or a combo guard with the ball … Shows good court vision and a willingness to create for others, illustrated by his 2.9 assists per game … Anticipates well on the glass, bringing in 6.5 rebounds in just 31 minutes per game … He’s long and athletic enough to be an effective defender at the next level … ",": From a physical standpoint, Burks needs to add bulk and muscle to his 192 pound body … Lacking strength and explosveness, he could struggle finishing at the rim in the pro’s, as opposed to college where he relied heavily on his athleticism … He shot poorly from downtown at just 29%, and really needs to become more of a consistent threat from the outside. Mechanics on his shot break down when he shoots from outside 15 feet. Sort of pushes the ball instead of shooting it in one fluid motion. Actually shows better mechanics when shooting moving towards the basket than when on balance and going straight up … Midrange game also lacked consistency, shooting too many off-balance jumpers off the dribble … Will need to adjust playing primarily off the ball with less opportunities to dominate the ball… Vulnerable defensively in one on one situations against smaller, quicker guards ",6-6,193,PG/SG,Colorado,So.,2011
Marcus Morris,": A mere role player as a freshman and sophomore, Marcus Morris quickly emerged as one of college basketball’s elite forwards in the country as a junior … Morris thrives off his versatility that allows him to maneuver from any position in the post … Shows the ability to turn over either shoulder with his back to the basket, making tough fadeaway jumpers look routine … Possesses advanced ball-skills, both at the high and low post … Extremely efficient scoring around the rim, showing an excellent touch and high awareness of his defender’s positioning … Strong balance/body control and effective pivot-steps to slide off defenders in the post for easier scoring opportunities … Shown the ability to face up and beat his man off the dribble… His jumpshot is excellent- terrific form, extremely fluid in catch and release situations… Has range out to 20 plus feet… Anticipates well on the glass..  Defensively he brings a strong work ethic with high intensity that should help make up for physical limitations in terms of height, length and explosiveness … ",": Morris lacks length, which could be problematic on both sides of the ball within ten feet of the rim (only averaged .6 blocks per game) … plays mostly under the rim, doesn’t possess the explosiveness you’d hope for from a forward with his athleticism … Has a limited ceiling – potential to be a long-term fixture in a rotation but not necessarily a bona fide star … Rebounding and shot-blocking numbers not overly impressive … Only shot 68% from free throw line …  ",6-8,230,SF/PF,Kansas,Jr.,2011

Chris Singleton,": A small forward with terrific size and length for the position … He is an explosive leaper and has next level athleticism … A very good player in transition, he runs the floor extremely hard and is able to finish plays above the rim in open lane situations … His upper body is well built, and he has the strength to move defenders on drives to the basket … Has developed into a formidable catch and shoot threat … With his feet set he can shoot the ball with range and fairly consistently knock down jumpers from deep … Shows the ability to make shots from the NBA three point line … His biggest impact is on the defensive end, where his size, length, athleticism and terrific instincts make him a lockdown defender … He possesses all the tools to be able to translate his defense to the NBA level … Can guard multiple positions … His ability to anticipate and jump into passing lanes combined with shotblocking, make him a very rare threat on the defensive side of the ball …  He is a blue-collar player and is capable of impacting the game without needing the ball in his hands or getting plays called for him … A solid rebounder, he is especially good on the O glass, where he uses his length and athleticism to get to rebounds …  ",": Not a natural wing player, he is not very smooth with the ball and does not have the ballhandling skills which would allow him to create his shot with consistency … Not a great scorer, lacks the feel and touch around the basket and depends too much on his physical prowess to get him thorough situations… Has the size and length to score with his back to the basket, but his poor footwork and bodycontrol make it hard for him to get good shots off inside … Still a very streaky shooter, especially on the move or off the dribble … He tends to shoot without squaring his body, his stroke is not the most natural, and his release comes too far off his head … His legs are fairly skinny but he is top heavy, which makes his movements awkward but it also gives him poor balance … Improved on his free throw percentage, but it’s still not where it needs to be …   Note: Singleton fractured his foot on Feb. 12 and had surgery shortly after.  It will be interesting to see when he is able to return and if he will be effective enough to keep his stock high enough to remain in the 2011 draft.

Marshon Brooks,": Brooks gradually increased his scoring average in each of his four years at Providence, finishing his senior year second in the country in scoring at 24.6 points per game … At 6’5, Brooks has nice size for an NBA two guard, but it’s his length that should allow him to get his shot off at the next level … He has an uncanny ability to create his own shot, using a variety of change of speed/hesitation dribble moves to create separation moving East/West or North/South … He’s proven capable of shooting both off the dribble and off catch and release situations, and has range out to the NBA three point line … His first step allows him to get into the lane, where he displays impressive body control that allows him to hit off balance shots around the rim … His long arms and high activity level also help contribute to 7 rebounds per game … With his length and capable lateral quickness, Brooks has the potential to be an effective defender with more focus and NBA coaching… ",": The ball has the tendency to stick to Brooks’ hands, causing teammates to stand around forcing stagnant and one and done offensive possessions … Doesn’t show the best shot selection, and throws up too many unnecessary heat checks … Physically he lacks the athleticism and explosiveness that most scoring NBA two-guards possess … He averaged close to 18 field goal attempts per game, so his scoring average could be inflated due to his role in Providence’s offense … He won’t have the opportunity to dominate the ball in the pros the way he does in college, so adjusting his spacing and adapting to his teammates could be a challenge for him in a new role … His body has good length but lacks great bulk/strength … Needs to put forth more intensity and effort on the defensive end …  ",6-5,195,SG,Providence,Sr.,2011

His moves are too predictable even against lesser competition … Lacks any real face the basket skills. Touch and consistency are not great. Scores mostly on put backs and buckets where he gains deep position in the paint, or is able to outclass opponents with his athleticism … A poor free throw shooter at below 60% throughout his college career. Doesn’t have terrible form, but needs to focus and improve his routine some … Passing and vision are limited. Needs to decrease turnovers.

Reggie Jackson,": At 6’3 with an outrageous 7’0 wingspan, Reggie Jackson is physically blessed as a prospect … On top of his physical tools, Jackson also possesses big-time athleticism to go with it . Has great quickness and speed, and really looks good penetrating … First step is dynamite … Likes to utilize extremely quick left-to-right crossovers to free himself of defenders … Capable of making the flashy play, but usually doesn’t overdo it … Not likely to have many struggles getting to the rim … Got much better about playing at different speeds, and it made him much harder to defend this past season … Shows explosive leaping skills, creativity in the air, and length make him more than capable of finishing plays in traffic amongst the trees … Improved at just about every facet of the game in each of his 3 years at Boston College … Went from a 29% 3-pont shooter to 42% guy on 1.5 more attempts, which is a huge leap … Very effective in the pick and roll … Likes to look for I his own first and foremost, but is unselfish and looks for teammates … Looks good in the drive and dish game … Excellent in transition, as you’d expect with his tools … His size, length and athleticism make him a potential nightmare on D against PG’s and some SG’s … Has the potential to be a very good ball thief … ",": Despite his great physical attributes, the main problem with that is he’s not a true PG by any stretch … Doesn’t always show the best floor vision when he’s on the way to the rim will occasionally miss open shooters … Although Jackson’s 3-point range and efficiency improved a lot, he shoots a set shot that is deliberate and takes him a lot of time to get off, which doesn’t project very well against NBA defenders … Sometimes is slow in his reads of weakside D, and gets charges or takes wild and difficult shots … With his added responsibility on offense this year, Jackson didn’t play on defense like he did in his 1st 2 years … Against the better, more athletic teams in the ACC, he struggled a bit with inefficiency, which suggests he’s not as prepared to be a truly good rotation player early on in his career … A bit ball-dominant and needs the ball to be effective throughout the game offensively … Could use more strength, but certainly has the frame to get bigger and stronger without the loss of athleticism … ",6-3,200,PG/SG,Boston College,Jr.,2011

Nikola Mirotic,": A 6’10” forward with potential. Actually the potential has already become a reality this season with Real Madrid, one of the traditional powerhouses and present at the recently played Euroleague Final Four. A good frame  … Yet he shows good balance, mobility and also a very nice wingspan … He’s got pretty good hands and a soft shooting touch, offering good reliability from beyond the arch up to the foul line. Shot selection is really excellent … He’s also willing to take the big shots to help win games … Might not be the quickest shooter, but his release and rhythm are good and he can create shots off the dribble when necessary. Able to score from the outside, able to penetrate and also a skilled low post player with a variety of moves … He handles the ball well with both hands for a guy of his size, and often helps to dribble the ball up court when the guard is being overplayed. Offensively Mirotic is tremendously versatile. Even if he’s missing better strength and athleticism, a good first step and very controlled drives gets him to draw many fouls. Adding to that a very high basketball IQ, good court awareness and anticipation, which allows him to make very quick decisions once he receives the ball. Spin moves (including over baseline foot), left and right up and unders and jump hooks, turn around jumpers, 45 degrees bank shots and shotfakes all form in a natural part of his repertoire. And he’s a reliable finisher inside. Apart from scoring himself, he contributes in the functioning of his team by making the ball move around on the perimeter. He also knows how to post up, seal off his position and maintain it. Being a good passer with an even better court vision enables him to find his teammates from the low post or out of dribble when driving towards the basket. In offensive rebounding he continuously tries to find a good position, often succeeding follow ups or at least getting touches to obtain a new possession. Defending pick and roll isn’t an issue either, considering his physical assets to hedge and recuperate as required. At this point defensively he can be matched up with both small and power forwards. Not a great shotblocker in the way of a top leaper who goes for each shot, nonetheless he manages to block a fair share of them due to very good help side positioning, timing and awareness.  ",": Even though agility and leaping are just average, surprisingly he’s quite quick off his feet and is able to run the floor well when he puts his mind to it … Over the years, there have been moments where a lack of motivation and concentration affected his running effort and activity on offense … Overall I would catalogue his athleticism as just okay for NBA standards … Has a good frame but will need to add additional strength … He is a better set shooter than creating shots for himself … He’s much more effective in half court offenses than in one on one fastbreak situations. When he’s on the receiving end in pick and roll plays, he mostly steps out the 3 point line and continues just occasionally inside. Even though he usually does box out and picks up defensive rebounds, rebounding is an aspect that he can still improve significantly.

Despite his youth, he is unquestionably thin and the issue remains just how much weight he can add, and how that added weight will affect his speed and agility … His shoulders suggest he can build on his frame, and he’s noticeably chiseled his arms, however a thin waist likely means he won;t be able to bulk up substantially … Must work on his core and lower body- easily gets pinned and backed down in the paint … Unable to establish and maintain position inside, often finding himself bumped off balance … Rarely used in isolation post-up’s during his freshman campaign, particularly given his size advantage on many nights and solid footwork … Offensive canvas is raw, with obvious enormous room for improvement … Doesn’t yet have a feel for his jump shot, often rushing the attempt and shooting a flat shot … There are times where he displays extreme comfort handling the ball, but face-up/dribble-drive maneuvers are few and far between … While he’s a tremendous secondary and tertiary leaper, he too often leaves his feet on pump fakes … It’s hard to fault him for being shot block happy, but the lack of discipline is not to his benefit …  His athleticism and length won’t cover up all shortcomings against super competition … Projecting Davis going forward, there’s not much to dislike … Physical maturity is the only visible hurdle standing in his path to beast mode.

Jeremy Lamb,": Long and lanky swingman with a nice athletic profile and a good skill-set for the off-guard position … Good size … Stands just over 6’5"" in shoes with a 6’11"" wingspan, which gives him great length for the shooting guard position in the NBA … Great leaping ability … Gets off the floor quickly … Has good explosiveness … Nice quickness, and moves well with or without the ball … Excellent all-around jump-shooter … Spots up well off the ball … Able to shoot comfortably in motion, from either mid-range or on the perimeter … Should be a very dangerous weapon in an NBA motion offense as somebody that can score consistently off of curls and v-cuts … Can also shoot off the dribble … Has a nice step-back move that creates a fair amount of separation … Due to his length and athleticism, has a high release on his jump shot that is difficult to defend … Has range out to the NBA three-point line … Good ball-handling skills that still have the potential to get better … Has shown the ability to break down defenders off the dribble, especially when driving to his left … Possesses a nice looking runner that he doesn’t use often, but could turn into an important skill down the road … Solid defender with a fair amount of potential left in this area … Good lateral quickness and length makes him difficult to beat off the dribble … Has been a clutch performer in the past, especially during UConn’s national title run in 2011 … A prospect that should be able to produce right away as somebody that excels playing off the ball, but also has the potential to become better at creating for himself …  ",": Very thin at this point … Added strength should help him finishing through contact in the future … Doesn’t shoot a lot of free-throws (3.6 attempts in 37.2 minutes per game) which is a real shame as he has the athleticism to get to the rim a lot and the touch to convert a high percentage of attempts from the stripe … Still limited when creating offense for himself … Most of the turnovers he commits occur due to his inexperience handling the ball … Strongly favors driving left and is extremely mistake prone when driving right … Three-point percentage dipped from 36.8% in 2010-2011 to 33.6% in 2011-2012, likely due to the extra attention teams could give him with Kemba Walker having left the team for the NBA … Effort level is inconsistent defensively …  ",6-5,179,SG,UConn,So.,2012
Terrence Ross,": Solid ball-handler …Very good court vision, finding teammates off P&R, or fast break … Runs the lane well in transition with ability to spot up on the wing or finish a lob … Lacks a conscience.

Andrew Nicholson,": A versatile power forward with a high basketball IQ … While he only has decent size for his position, his tremendous length allows him to play much bigger … Extremely efficient scorer, he has made himself into a reliable inside threat (shows a nice mini hook over his left shoulder, is able to utilize an effective up and under and is also dangerous with a turnaround jumper) … Possesses an intriguing face up game, he has good quickness and regularly shows his ability to work off the dribble … He always had the ability to step out and shoot with range, but became a deadly option from beyond the arc during his final 10 collegiate games (he made 19/30 from long range during that time)… For a big man, his stroke is very smooth, he shoots the ball with good balance and is able to get good lift … He is a dangerous weapon setting screens on the ball as he loves to step out on pick and pop situations and is good at attacking the rotating defender because of his ability to sell the shotfake and then put the ball on the deck … Exceptionally good at moving without the ball, reads space and finds the openings in the gaps … During the 2nd part of his senior season, they ran him off staggered screens because of his ability to get open and knock down jumpers … Solid rebounder on both ends of the floor thanks to his length (but will need to attack the glass on a more consistent effort at the next level, as he won’t be able to get away with coasting like he did at times in college) … Very good shot blocker, has good timing and is aggressive coming from the weakside to contest shots … Has become consistent and reliable from the free-throw line …  ",": Even though his body has improved during his collegiate career, he needs to continue working on it … He still lacks the bulk and upper body strength to consistently battle inside and he has a hard time establishing low post position against stronger players … Gets bodied and coerced into off balance shots … Good, but not a great athlete … His motor is a bit of a question mark, he has a tendency to take plays off on both ends of the floor and especially down the stretch of games … A bit selective as far as running the floor in transition … His condition must also improve as he has looked winded in the 2nd half of games … Turnover prone, he is not a great passer, especially out of double teams … Struggles operating in traffic and has a tendency to attack and spin into help defenders … Needs to continue adding more pieces to his low post repertoire, especially counter moves going to his left hand …  ",6-10,234,PF,St. Bonaventure,Sr.,2012
Moe Harkless,": Harkless passes the eye test at 6’8 with smooth athleticism and great length (wingspan is roughly 7’2) … His ability to attack the rim from the perimeter gives him a distinct advantage over his defender who is unlikely to share his agility … Quick first step and comfortable handle and footwork for his size …  He has a great feel for the rim, and can score by hitting off-balance shots at awkward angles … His jumper has range out to 20 feet, and although he shot poorly from downtown, he has promising mechanics, especially when his feet are set … He’s got a quick second jump: he gets off the ground and reaches the ball before his defender, resulting in tip-ins and rebounds given his length … Runs the floor like a guard … Defensively he reads passing lanes extremely well, and frequently gets tips, deflections or blocks playing off the ball … ",": Skill level is still in between the 4 and 3 positions, scoring frequently around the basket due to his length and athleticism … Harkless struggles to create easy shots for himself in the half court, especially on the perimeter as a shooter … Pull up off the dribble is not really in his repertoire… Only shot 44%, a low number considering his size and athleticism… Needs to add muscle… Number one task is to improve as a shooter, which will maximize his services playing the 3 … ",6-8,207,SF,St. Johns,Fr.,2012
Arnett Moultrie,": High-level athlete combo forward with excellent size and length. Versatile offensive skill set to score inside/outside (16.5 PPG). Could be seen as being big enough to play center in today’s NBA. He possesses rare agility at 6’11 in tandem with a hunger for activity and relentless motor. Runs the court like a guard, with a fluid gait and long, easy strides.  Nightmare matchup for opponents on the interior due to explosive quickness and elevation. Extraordinarily nimble and quick mover in the paint. He has added strength and bulk (225 to 240) without losing that calling card explosiveness. Uses his athleticism to earn high percentage looks (58%), elevating above defenders. Displays a deft touch and equally adept at finishing with his left hand. Electric spin moves in the post over either shoulder, preferring to attack baseline. Body control and hang time to make the appropriate in-air adjustments and alter release after a bump or if impeded. 83% free throw shooter on over 5 attempts (65% as sophomore). Rebounds at will on both the offensive and defensive backboards, ranking amongst the nation’s leaders with 10.8 per game. Quick leaper on multiple jumps while still retaining 1st jump lift. Utilizes his length and mobility to rebound out his direct vicinity. Flourished on the perimeter during his time at UTEP, albeit in a more liberal style of play. Comfortable in the mid-range with the ability to step out behind the three-point stripe. He has the potential to be an effective face-up weapon with a quick first step and long frame. Had a tendency to play in a “rushed state” early in his collegiate career, but has found an efficient pace his junior season. Doesn’t force shots and playing within a more defined role for the betterment of the team. He displays legit lateral quickness and foot speed to defend on the perimeter and not look like a fish out of water. Multiple position defensive adaptability. Mentally and physically a different player since arriving in the SEC. ",": Moultrie seems to have transitioned from a SF to PF this season, sacrificing continued perimeter development in the process. Being that he’s not a true post option, he’ll likely see time at both spots on the next level. He’s caught somewhere in between, which can actually be viewed as a strength and serves to illustrate his versatility. Has shown glimpses of range shooting and ball handling aptitude, but more is required for the NBA small forward position.  As he exhibited at UTEP, the potential to be a dynamic face up player is very much present. It’s that potential alone, despite his raw attributes that once again has scouts drooling over his package of skills. Not the most technically sound of prospects, relying on his massive (on most nights) talent, size and athletic advantage. Plays too quickly at times (2.2 TO) and must harness his energy. Could still stand to add more bulk, be more accepting of contact and get to the FT line more consistently. When he begins a move, thinks score only. Not selfish, but at the same time not a prudent passer when attracting defensive attention. At 6’11 with his length and leaping ability, it is inexplicable that he hasn’t been able to block a shot per game (0.9) in any of his three seasons. Basketball IQ and awareness on both ends should sharpen with experience. Moultrie has missed three games in 2011-2012 with tendinitis in both knees.   ",6-11,233,PF,Mississippi St.,Jr.,2012
Marquis Teague,": Physically he’s extremely athletic with a quick first step, good size and stays low to the ground … Teague improved as facilitator as his freshman year progressed, looking more and more comfortable running a half court set … Teague’s at his best breaking down a defense off the dribble and then exploiting switches and late rotations to find the open man …  Looks more natural as a playmaker in the drive and dish game, keeping his head up while showing a willingness to kick it out to shooters … Really has a solid understanding of how to manipulate a defense, draw off-ball defenders away from their man and then hit his target with accuracy and timeliness … Runs the pick and roll/pick and pop effectively for a young point guard … Runs the break with a combination of speed and poise … Can finish at the rim using his athleticism to elude defenders for uncontested layups … Can knock down midrange jumpers when given room and space … Shows sound footwork and promise defensively with active hands … Good frame and body strength for a player his age …  ",": Lacks NBA range (32% from three) on his jumper with a somewhat unorthodox release … Struggles with touch in traffic on runners and floaters … Turnover prone in half court, sometimes forcing a pass or over-dribbling … Transition from scorer to playmaker could take time, as he still seems unsure of himself as a distributor in the half court … Only shot 71% from the line … ",6-2,189,PG,Kentucky,Fr.,2012
Jared Sullinger,": Highly refined, old school post player in a draft saturated with “potential”. His game is marked by both power and skill. Legitimate low block scorer often working his way into a high quality look (17.5 PPG on 52% FG). Master of positioning at 280 pounds and establishes early. Uses his wide body and derriere to keep defenders locked onto his hip. Tremendous lower body strength pinning his opponents into submission. Aggressively throws his weight around and unafraid to punish those in his path. Thrives on contact. Wide array of post moves on the low block, finishing over either shoulder with either hand. Footwork and understanding of angles are advanced. Soft hands and a feathery touch. Nimble elusivity for his size. He has taken strides in the face-up game, working from the elbow area in space without threat of a double. He’s a dual threat from there, either comfortably popping a mid-range jumper or attacking off the bounce with skilled handle. Quickness is not his ally, but he’s a bull in a china shop. Technically sound jump shot with smooth release. Range has extended to three-point territory, shooting 40% on over 1 attempt per game last season. 77% shooter at the free throw stripe, to which he is a frequent visitor. Strong basketball IQ- reads double teams, finds the open man and rarely get careless with the ball (1.2 AST: 1.9 TO). Excellent anticipation on the glass, clears room with his big frame (9 RPG, 3 Offensive). Intuitive defender with good hands (1.2 steals). Averaged a shade over a block per game last year, a healthy upgrade from 0.5 as a freshman. Added muscle weight and improved conditioning that resulted in more effective minutes at full strength, as well as more explosive movements. ",": Lacks the overall physical gifts of other top prospects in the draft class. Appears stuck in glue at times, particularly against long, athletic competition. His space-creating advantage and wide base are nullified. No elevation off the floor and severely limited explosion. Plays beneath the rim. Run the courts laboriously. Lateral quickness is poor- badly exposed in space and on pick and roll switches. Undersized for the center position, a shortcoming he does not make up for in length. Major concerns defensively against new breed, mobile NBA 4’s. Not an intimidating presence on the back line of a defense. Less than a blocked shot per game in conference play, and does not alter attempts either. Averaged more steals than blocks. Position defender. He’s overwhelmed by size, length and athleticism on both sides of the ball. The majority of his dominant efforts came against lesser competition and teams devoid of frontline size. His 5/19 performance in his final collegiate game against Kansas did not aid his draft standing. His body style will always be susceptible to weight issues. Can’t afford to rest on his laurels and be satisfied with current level of conditioning and agility if he wants to remain in the lottery.  ",6-9,268,PF,Ohio St.,So.,2012

Jeffery Taylor,": Has some of the best physical tools of an any wing prospect in the 2012 class … Stands at 6’7 and weighs just under 230 lbs, and is put together very nicely, with his muscle being evenly placed throughout his upper and lower body … On top of being physically mature, Taylor is also a high-level athlete who is very fast for his size and a powerful leaper who likes to take off on 2 feet … Strong finisher who has highlight-reel caliber athleticism, but is much more likely to finish with a safe, and often powerful, 2-hand jam than he is to try a fancy dunk … Runs the floor extremely well, and can beat the entire defense down the floor for easy buckets at times … Taylor is best on offense when he can move without the ball to find open spots to get high percentage looks around the basket … Will make a big man pay if they aren’t aware of him on the weakside … You have to watch out for him on baseline slashes … Is effective on straight line slashes to the rim, where his quick step, strength, long strides and athleticism allow him to be effective on his way to the hoop … Improved his jump shot nicely in his 4 years at Vandy … Came to college with no 3 point range, and took steps forward in each of his seasons, being a 42% shooter from deep as a Sr. on more than 4 attempts a night … Also got better from mid-range as his career progressed … Has high-level potential on the defensive end, and his defense could be where his most value as a prospect lies … Is versatile on this end, and defended everything except C when at Vandy…Is very fundamentally sound and moves his feet very well … Has the size to defend SG’s and a lot of the bigger SF’s in time … Was arguably the best defending wing in the SEC last season, even though Kentucky’s Michael Kidd-Gilchrist got most of the pub … Always contests shots … Is great at knowing when to gamble for passing lane steals and when to just play solid defense against his man … Solid passer, who is unselfish and plays within the scheme … Doesn’t play outside of his role, and seems to be an unselfish teammate … Has some ability to post up due to playing extended time at the PF spot for Vandy, and isn’t bad in these instances with a basic jump hook … Rebounds pretty well on the wing on both ends, but particularly offensively … Improved very steadily over his career, developing everything from his jump shot to even his body … Could be better in an up-tempo style than at a slower pace like Vandy played … Extremely productive player for Vandy, who was on the All-SEC 1st Team as a Sr., and 2nd Team as a Soph. and Jr … Started every game except 1 during his Vandy career, a testament to his durability and value to the program … ",": The biggest chink in Taylor’s arsenal is clearly his ball-handling ability … Struggles with change of direction dribbles, and was used in these instances a bit too much for Vandy which magnified it a bit more than it probably should’ve been … Shouldn’t be asked to take more than 2 or 3 dribbles offensively to be at his best … Very reliant on his strong (right) hand … Although Taylor is a great athlete, he is a bit mechanical with the ball in his hands … Even with his jump being a weapon for him his last 2 seasons, teams will want to see how he adjusts to the deeper NBA range and prove that he is respectable with his shot … Mediocre mid-range game … Has a history of disappearing from games at bad times and having shaky confidence and aggression … Physically gifted, but has a 6’6 wingspan and seemingly small hands at 6’7, which is subpar for his size and may make him play a hair smaller than he actually is … Doesn’t project to be more than a 4th option scorer at best whenever he’s on the floor … ",6-7,213,SF,Vanderbilt,Sr.,2012
Evan Fournier,": Has a really solid, strong body that helps him attacking the rim; he is not so explosive, but his first step allows him to beat opponents off the dribble … Very crafty offensively. He is a natural talent, and can score in many ways: shooting from three, attacking the basket and spotting up … Very adept at driving and dishing … Also has a nice left hand, and can grab rebounds, both in offense and defense … The trademark to his game is his ability to score clutch baskets. He seems to live for crunch time … Sees the floor exceptionally well for a 19 year old … He also is a very difficult defensive assignment because he is always in motion, working hard to get open looks … Defensively, he has nice position and good foot work, plays smart, not overly aggressive … Tremendous attitude, work ethic. Willing to put the work in to maximize his abilities …  ",": Plays below the rim. Below average explosiveness will make finishing at the rim a challenge for him in the NBA … He doesn’t have any great defects, but absolutely needs to improve his three point shot, still too inconsistent to be a threat at the NBA level … He can do almost everything on the basketball court, but has areas that must be improved upon: he must pass better, shoot with more confidence, finish better …  ",6-7,204,SG,France,Intl.,2012
Doron Lamb,": Highly efficient offensive player (50% FG) with an old school style … Assassin-like scorer (16.5 PPG) in the ""crafty"" mold … The mid-range game is his natural comfort zone, but his three-point aptitude has been a revelation (49% as freshman, 52% as soph) … His jumpshot mechanics are clean and he gets solid elevation … Shows the ability to put the ball on the deck with either hand, and his aggression level is on the uptick (4.5 FT attempts) … His go to move off the dribble is a cross over + step back to create space for a mid-range J … Plays at a controlled pace in congruency with his calm and cool demeanor (0.5 TO) … No wasted emotional energy on the court … Shot selection is no longer a concern, as he stays within his role in the offensive structure and doesn’t force opportunities … Extremely active trying to get open off the ball … Utilizes screens effectively and has a quick trigger in catch and shoot situations … Defensive effort is a staple … Makes up for lack of size with tremendous length and moves well laterally … His projected role at the next level is already defined: a knock down shooter with well rounded skills and the ability to handle if necessary … Also shows the versailtiy to play the point position in spot duty as he did as a freshman backing up Knight as well as in High School at Oak Hill … ",": Despite his ability to score the rock, the fact remains that he’s caught between positions … He lacks the playmaking ability (1.6 assists as fresh, 2.8 as soph) to handle the point guard spot full time, and the size/strength to effectively defend NBA two’s … Remains a shoot first, shoot second, create third guard … He’s added weight, but must get stronger … While Lamb is a smooth athlete, he has no eye popping tools … Explosive lift and extreme quickness are not part of his repertoire … Not overly inclined to attack the bucket or finish at the rim … Will struggle to get his own shot against premiere athletes, reliant on an offensive set or someone to create for him … A complimentary part on a winning team, similar to his current role at Kentucky … Doesn’t have the personality or elite physical gifts to take over a game … ",6-4,199,SG,Kentucky,So.,2012
Will Barton,": Wiry thin swingman at 6’6 with tremendous length … Production increased exponentially from freshman to sophomore campaigns … Versatile and creative scorer without a distinct offensive pattern (18 PPG). Lethal in the mid-range shooting off the dribble … Quick trigger. Effortless range from downtown, strong wrists … Consistency from deep on the incline (35%) from standstill and utilizing screens … High percentage of drives/slashes to the basket result in a floater or short jumper, both of which he is adept at converting … Soft touch gives the ball a chance when hitting the rim, gets many friendly rolls … Look no further than his 51% field goals to assess advancements in shot selection … Overall decision making has been cultivated in a short time frame … Plays with a newfound patience- probing the defense and seeking out a high-quality look for himself or a teammate … Herky jerky off the dribble repertoire, hesitation dribble suits his style … Possesses a quick first step and long, loping strides … If he gets past you he’s at the hoop in a hurry … Able to squirt through small openings in the defense while remaining on balance … Excellent body control around the rim. Ability to suspend himself in air allows for sublime body contortions … Creates unconventional angles due to exceptionally long arms. Above average athlete … Excels in transition where he gobbles up ground and is a strong two-footed leaper … Premiere rebounding guard in the country (8 RPG) that results in instant fast break opportunities, due to his ability to take the ball coast to coast …  Nose for the rock. Spent more time with the ball in his hands as a sophomore, showing glimpses of burgeoning passing skills and court vision (2.9 APG) … Disruptive weapon defensively (1.4 SPG & 0.7 BPG). Can guard positions 1-3 with his length and fluid lateral movements … A great kid, charismatic individual with an infectious personality …  ",": Must get stronger. Classification as “thin” is an understatement. Body type doesn’t suggest he can add weight comfortably. Avoids contact and physical encounters at the rim- struggles to finish through a bump … A slight bump when off balance can send him reeling … Gets to the free throw line due to awkward style more so than consistent aggression (5 attempts per game) … Lacks elite level explosiveness … Despite improvements in shot selection and decision making (2.8 TO), momentary lapses of reason still invade his game … Has a tendency to settle, particularly in physical matchups … At times displays a lack of confidence in his handle, picking up his dribble unnecessarily when unable to beat his defender … Off the dribble variety is not a staple. His natural feel for putting the ball in the hoop is absent in the remainder of his offensive skill package … While shooting range is not in question, consistency is … Doesn’t use his base or get much elevation on his jumper … Adjustment to complimentary part status will be integral, playing off the ball and not dominating it. Does he have the strength to guard opposing 2’s and 3’s in the league? Likely to be bullied by power guards and wings … It’s difficult to define how his skill sets translate to the next level, as Barton is a unique player without a clear-cut role … He’s also a year old for his grade, born January 1991, so that must be taken into account when guaging his potential …  ",6-6,174,SG/SF,Memphis,So.,2012
Quincy Miller,": An incredibly skilled prospect, Miller has ideal size and a ridiculously lengthy (7’3) wingspan for a scoring small forward … Displays precise footwork, making every step a purposeful one … Despite previous ACL surgery, Miller is a mobile athlete that can slip and slide off his defender … With the ball in his hands, Miller is a crafty shot-creator on the perimeter, doing most of his offensive damage in the midrange … Uses impressive handle on the ball to create shots off the dribble on the perimeter, showing a high awareness of his defender’s positioning and an understanding of how to take advantage of that … Possesses balance after using effective pivots to get his shot off … Effectively uses off-ball screens to get open … As a finisher and scorer down low, Miller’s scoring instincts allow him to convert in a number of different ways despite lacking the strength and explosiveness to get easier buckets … Mentally tough , competitor … ",": Miller looks to have lost some speed and explosiveness after tearing his ACL as a senior in high school, which could make it difficult for him to free himself for open looks and shoot a respectable percentage at the next level … Not very impressive on the break and in the open floor … He gets little elevation on his jump shot with a low release, leaving his three-point shots easier to contest … Over his last 12 games, Miller shot 2 for 18 from downtown, making you question whether his hot shooting start was flukey (finished at 34%) … Needs to add bulk to his wiry frame … Not a force on the glass … Inconsistent from a game to game basis as a freshman … Only averaged 3 free throw attempts per game … Appears lackadaisical at times defensively, and could be vulnerable defending stronger, faster players in isolation situations … ",6-10,219,SF,Baylor,Fr.,2012
Alex Len,": Athletic specimen at 7’1 with highly intriguing physical canvas … He’s a legit 5-man with incredible coordination and agility for his size … Gets up and down the court with ultimate comfort at 255 pounds … Back to the basket game is on the incline- did a much better job establishing and holding position as a sophomore … Quick and decisive moves, predominantly over his left shoulder … Effortless leaping ability and 7’3.5 wingspan result in frequent high percentage looks (53% FG), many above the rim … Active and willing mover without the ball, averaging 1.48 PPP on basket cuts (52 possessions) … Consistent shooting mechanics with significant room for development; occasionally will flash confidence letting fly in the mid-range … 69% free throw shooter … Willing passing with burgeoning feel for the game (1 APG) … He’s added 30 pounds since arriving on campus from his professional club in the Ukraine … Imposing upper body with wide set shoulders, supporting additional muscle should not be a concern … One rebound every 3.3 minutes on the floor … He possesses all the tools to be a prolific rebounder on both backboards (2.9 ORPG) … Intimidating presence in the middle filling the role of rim protector (2.1 BLK) … Capable of deterring shots both on ball and weakside … Mobile defensively, unafraid to engage the pick and roll ball handler … Moves well laterally and retreats on balance. Len will turn 20 on June 16th … ",": Len remains a raw product when forced to make a move outside of a few feet … Limited resources with ball in hand … Face up game is not a part of his repertoire despite high level agility compared to his center counterparts- same can be proclaimed for his effectiveness, or lack thereof, in the pick and pop … Nuances of the P&R need cultivation… Over time he should become a natural rolling to the hoop. Assertiveness and dominant mindset not yet trademarks, as buttressed by his underwhelming 8.5 FGA and 4 FTA per game … Lower body/base must get stronger to defend the post and maintain position on the offensive block … Often found himself in foul trouble with defensive discipline a work in progress … After declaring for the draft it was revealed he would miss 4-6 months of practice time with a stress fracture in his ankle … It should be noted that ankle issues were a common theme during his two years at College Park … Unable to participate in combine drills where he would have been an ideal candidate to impress in the athletic testing … Adam Ganeles 6/7/13 Strengths: Tall, long and intimidating center with developing offensive ability … Impressive athlete for a 7’1"" player … Quick off his feet … Runs up and down the court with ease … Hard for defenders to keep tabs on, due to his activity without the ball … Sets a lot of screens … Soft touch around basket … Gets a lot of tip-ins off of offensive rebounds … Effective in the post due to his length and touch … Really competes for post-position … Solid shooter, that displays range out to 18 feet already … Should become a better free-throw shooter in time … Passing ability is solid … A natural shot-blocker that uses his physical tools and great timing to swat a lot of shots … Poised enough to not bite on most shot fakes … Works hard to deny post-entry passes on defense…  Mobility should make him a good pick-and-roll defender in time … Very green … Has a high ceiling …  ",7-1,255,C,Maryland,So.,2013
Victor Oladipo,": Explosive athlete who plays with great energy and aggression on both ends of the floor … Fearless slasher, with potential to be dangerous as a transition player … Plays passing lanes very well, and has a great nose for the ball … Improved his jump shot considerably, known for having a fantastic work ethic … Improvement over the past year has been remarkable and a testament to his work ethic. Shows a great will to improve, by all reports a fantastic kid and considered very coachable … Quite strong, very good at playing prevent defense and establishing position …  Shot selection was highly efficient during his junior season, seemed to know his role and limitations … Has potential as a passer, though still keeps it quite simple … Follows shots really well, does not give up on plays and good at creating turnovers in the backcourt … Length and timing to block shots occasionally, good help defender … Worked on his handle and showed noticeable improvement during his final season at IU … Potentially can become a player with blow by quickness due to his great speed … Pesky defender who prides himself on guarding the other team’s best perimeter scorer … Could guard multiple positions, even at the NBA level … Though he did not average over 30 mpg, conditioning and stamina appear to be top notch, should be able to log a good number of minutes ",": Still very much a work in progress as a complete offensive player … Was not even on team’s radars as a first rounder going into junior season. Begging the question, did he overachieve? … Despite improving his outside shot, had a very limited sample size from long distance and as a midrange jump shooter … Has a difficult time creating offense off of the dribble, and this is an area that arguable may not improve a ton … Has never been counted on as a featured offensive threat, something that will more than likely be expected of him in his current draft range … Despite his attacking nature and great athleticism, only got to the line for 3.6 FTA … Forced into a high number of turnovers, particularly when trying to create in isolation … Due to his aggressive nature, can get into foul trouble, will need to learn to let certain things go in order to not to pick up cheap fouls … No real go-to move as an offensive player, especially considering he will be going up against players close to his size, quickness in the NBA … More bark than bite? His defensive analytics did not necessarily follow his reputation as a shut down defender, which could be something to monitor … Will he still manage to stay as efficient as his junior year percentages dictated once he is asked to do more offensively? ",6-4,213,SG/SF,Indiana,Jr.,2013
Otto Porter,": Porter is a multi-skilled small forward possessing tremendous length (7’1 wingspan) and veteran basketball savvy at 19-years of age. He’s in constant motion away from the ball, roaming the baseline, cutting backdoor or settling into soft spots. Utilizes that same motor to get out in the open court and runs exceedingly well end to end; averages 1.45 PPP in transition. Plays to his strengths and works hard to ameliorate areas of weakness. He upped his scoring output from 9.7 as a freshman to 16.2 as a sophomore (48% FG). The key ingredient to his offensive explosion was improved long-range proficiency, from 23% to 42% (12 makes to 43). 51% adjusted FG% in spot up opportunities. Highly efficient in the mid-range from either elbow — catch and shoot coming off screens (or working the middle of 2-3) and dribbling into jumpers with one or two habit bounces. His unorthodox style and arm length frequently result in contact; makes excellent use of the pump fake. He gets to the free throw stripe 5 times per game and converts at 77%. Prudent decision maker with ball in hand when asked to facilitate in the Princeton system- 2.7:1.5 assist: turnover ratio. In sync with teammates and uses the dribble to create better passing angles. His feel for the game and nose for the ball are highlighted on the boards. His length/motor/instincts (reading caroms) allow him to chase down misses outside of his area (7.5 REB). Contests every jump shot– even when a shooter creates space, his wingspan negates a clear look (0.9 BLK). Hedges screens aggressively and disrupts hand-offs (1.8 STL). Porter was a late bloomer that did not play on the AAU circuit. Finished classes after declaring for the draft and gets the” big picture”. Stable performer, never see him flustered.  ",": Smooth run/jump athlete but missing the trademark explosion of a lottery talent. The power quotient is noticeably absent as well. While muscle definition is more noticeable, he has not added substantial bulk in his two years (from 200 to 205). It appears he has the broad shoulders to support more weight. He lacks the tools to impose his will on the game. Has difficulty creating clean looks for himself- off the dribble creativity is elementary and he’s more slippery/slithery than quick. Aptitude shooting off the bounce is often condensed to 1 or 2 dribbles, doesn’t rise up and elevate off hard drives. Not a consistent breakdown candidate, dependent on another playmaker or garbage buckets in the half court. Limited albeit diverse role player. Porter was utilized as a “pick and pop” threat just three times all season, failing to showcase potentially his greatest attribute as an undersized 4. His jump shot mechanics are awkward with elbows out and funky sidespin rotation. To his credit, he’s made it work a la Shawn Marion. Top-notch defender in all situations that don’t require side to side movement in open space. There are clear shortcomings in the lateral quickness department, which he masks with makeup speed and length. Injury note: He wore a right knee brace during the season’s final month after banging knees on February 20th.  Adam Ganeles 5/7/13 Strengths: Porter is a rising Soph. wing prospect with a lot of raw potential after emerging into an important player for Georgetown despite being a lightly touted late bloomer out of HS … Pretty unique type of player with an unorthodox style … Possesses great size and length on the wing at 6’8 with a lot of length, (7’1 wingspan) and a 205 lb frame that can definitely add plenty of muscle … Very smooth athleticism and nice balance for a guy his height … Plays a smart, composed game as you’d expect from a JT3-coached player … Understands his role on both ends, and rarely plays outside of his own comfort zone … Moves very well off the ball, and presents himself with about 2 or 3 very high percentage shots every game … Not going to make many mistakes finishing around the rim, where his solid athleticism and imposing length are all beneficial to him … Effective with unorthodox short range jumpers from just outside of the paint … Heady passer, who will reward cutters when there is a passing lane to do so … Doesn’t need to hold the ball for a lot of time to make an impact when on the court … Unselfish … Good rebounder on both ends of the floor partially due to his length, and is also willing to dive on the floor and get physical on the glass…Has the ability to get chase down blocks when beaten off the dribble, and is never completely out of plays defensively when defending 1-on-1 … Enough length to effectively defend SF’s of any size in the long term … Will continue to get better as he adds strength and polish … Was productive for a guy who wasn’t heavily relied upon last season … Will probably benefit a lot by the experience he gained this past year … ",6-9,200,SF,Georgetown,So.,2013
Nerlens Noel,": One of the best pure shot blockers to come along in a number of years … He’s a more explosive leaper and has better on ball shot blocking ability than last year’s UK freshman intimidator Anthony Davis. While Davis had a little better lateral speed and ability to get to shots as a weakside defender, Noel’s ability to deny his man any daylight to the rim and be a rim protector makes him even more dominant, and a potential defensive enforcer for the NBA … An elite level athlete with great quickness and explosive leaping ability … Great length, reported 7’4 wingspan … Showed surprising ability to get steals using his quick hands (2.1 per game), though some of those reach ins will draw fouls and not be as sucessful in the NBA … Must get stronger but has the potential to play both post positions: power forward and center … A good kid, with a strong work ethic … Competes. Plays with great energy and effort … His great length, explosiveness and natural timing which makes him such a dominant shot blocker also makes him a great rebounder and ally oop/put back dunker … Strong rebounder. Shows a willingness to bang inside and fight for rebounds. 9.5 rpg … Good hands to snatch rebounds and make one handed put backs in spectacular fashion … As raw as he is, he seems to have a solid feel for the game and understanding of how to play to his strengths … Showed development in his freshman season, learning to get a wide base, call for the ball, keep it away from guards and make plays, though unpolished, towards the basket … Has developed a little baby hook shot with either hand that has shown some success at times … Shows the ability to face up and get by slower defenders using the dribble … Surprisingly good passer for a bigman. His near 1-1 a/to ratio shows that he passes well and also doesn’t turn the ball over a great deal … His impact on UK has been most apparent after his injury, with the team losing their first game w/out him by 30 to Tennessee … While he lacks much muscle tone, he does show very good aggressiveness attacking the basket and is ""wiry strong"" … While his ACL injury takes some of the luster off of him as a prospect due to the unknowns surrounding him returning to 100%, the fact that he’s so young and today’s technology with athletes such as Adrian Peterson having made such amazing recoveries after surgery helps his cause … ",": Offensively, Noel’s game is rudimentary. He has shown some development but the general perception is that he will never be a strong offensive player, instead he impacts games with his defense, rebounding and athleticism … Won’t be able to ""out-athleticize"" opponents for baskets at the next level the way he has in college … Scores mainly on put backs and dunks when he gets a clear path to the basket, or when teammates are able to create for him. That being said, his great foot speed allows him to get by inferior opponents off the dribble at times … Post game is very weak, as a high school player he focused too much on trying to face the basket and use ball handling instead of embracing the idea of being a post player all the time. His lack of post moves/instincts are a result … Lacks touch even around the rim as he’s had some painful misses from point blank range, missing by 2 feet from 4 feet away, etc. … Shows quick feet and explosiveness to get by slower defenders but struggles to make any real post moves. His foot work needs a good deal of improvement … His shooting ability is a major weakness as his lack of a crisp form is apparent when he shoots from the FT line. Lacks a clean, smooth motion, he slings the ball, pushing it instead of allowing his wrists to have a natural release … Legs are alarmingly thin and there could be some concern that the knee injury came as a result of his lack of leg strength … Narrow shoulders will challenge his ability to bulk up considerably. Though there are plenty of NBA bigmen that have had success in the 230 range (which is likely where he will wind up) … His 53% ft shooting illustrates his lack of shooting fundamentals … Unusual athlete, while on one hand he’s an elite level run jump guy with tremendous reflexes and quickness, he plays extremely upright and is stiff and lacking fluidity in some regards … ",6-11,206,PF/C,Kentucky,Fr.,2013
Ben McLemore,": Prototypical 2-guard with a mouth watering combination of athleticism and shooting ability … A top shelf athlete with spectacular leaping ability and body control … Appears to have just scratched the surface of his abilities in his one season of college ball … Without question has elite level NBA 2 guard potential with the talent to eventually place himself among the top shooting guards in the league in his prime … Shooting efficiency was off the charts for a freshman, hitting 50% FG, 42% 3p and 87% from the line (totaling 179, he was a point away from being in the 180 club) More efficient shooting than Steph Curry was in his freshman season at Davidson (172) … Smooth operator. His jump shot is absolutely a thing of beauty and rarely do you find such a gorgeous stroke on such a gifted athlete … Shoots with a fluid and concise motion and takes the same shot every time. Gets excellent elevation and has a quick release … Has range out to college 3, and there’s no reason to think he won’t be able to extend to the NBA line … If he plays with a top level PG, he will be deadly in catch and shoot situations … His pull up off the dribble shows a lot of potential, as does his ability to blow by defenders due to a quick first step … Ball handling potential is there. Has much better ball handling ability than he’s been given credit for. Shows one and two dribble pull up skills, plus can utilize three and four dribble moves to get to the rim … When asked to isolate, has done a good job of creating off the dribble, though was rarely asked to be a primary ball handler, or ISO, and spent most of his time running off screens for spot up looks … Excellent off the ball, using constant motion to tire out opponents and has been coached well to wait for screens and run his man off them to free himself for looks … Great at finding seems in the defense, running the baseline for ally oop dunks … Has a chance to be an excellent defender due to his length and lateral speed. Despite their reputations, McLemore actually graded out much higher on overall defense in Synergy analytical statistics than Victor Olidipo … McLemore allowed .625 PPP (points per possession) scoring in the 89 percentile (Oladipo .856 PPP and in the 39th percentile) Granted Oladipo has better ISO defensive analytics … Unselfish, team player who shows solid ability to pass the ball for an off guard (even a/to ratio) … Good size at 6’4.75 in shoes with a 6’7.75 wingspan … Persevered through a rough upbringing showing a fortitude and inner strength … ",": ""Lacks assertiveness"" and ""passivity"" are the two most common criticisms that have been made about him. Is it possible that the bar was set a little high for a freshman that averaged 15.9 ppg on highly efficient numbers? … Still must learn how to operate in pressure situations and develop focus and mental toughness … It’s easy to confuse a lack of focus for a lack of passion, and it’s a real possibility that his struggles were more related to inexperience and concentration lapses instead of competitiveness or mental toughness issues … A young and naive kid, there are some concerns about how he will handle all of NBA’s off court temptations and not get caught up in the ""lifestyle"". By all accounts a good kid, who just needs solid people around him steering him in the right direction, making positive decisions … Just one season of college ball after redshirting his first year at Kansas due to Academics … Some worry about his maturity level and confidence after his interviews and workouts. He reportedly was out of shape and unprepared during the draft process … Extremely humble kid. May need time to grow and mature, develop a better feel for the game, defensive spacing, etc. He will likely gain confidence and develop a swagger in time … The truth is he’s a great kid who’s just naive, like most 20 year olds … As one scout put it, ""Just imagine what he’ll be like when he gets some confidence and hits his stride"" … Had one dreadful performance against North Carolina (2 pts 0-9 fg) during their tourney run in which he disappeared and somewhat crumbled under the pressure, and detractors point to this game as proof that he lacks a killer instinct or the ""alpha dog"" personality. In reality the same criticisms could be made about Bradley Beal for ""running from the basketball"" in the key minutes of Florida’s loss to Louisville in the NCAA tournament. McLemore bounced back with 20 pts on 8-15 in their next and last game vs. Michigan … Sometimes the moment overcomes players and only a fool would judge a player based on one college performance … Needs to work on his ISO game, become a better ball handler and not be so careless turning the ball over … Where McLemore struggled defensively was in isolation, showing a need to expand his feel for the game, focus on fundamentals, get lower and not bite on fakes as heavily. Shows solid effort, he just needs to make a better effort of getting low, anticipating, and not allowing opponents to get by him on penetration … Had an extremely tough upbringing so there are some concerns about how he will be able to handle immediate riches … Two years at Kansas were crucial for his maturity and long term development off the court, but has a bigger adjustment curve than the average prospect and needs time and patience from the team that invests a pick in him … ",6-5,190,SG,Kansas,Fr.,2013
Trey Burke,": Point guard with tremendous heart and determination … Many of the cliche attributes fit him: A natural born killer. Fearless warrior. Fierce competitor. Has a will to win. Will battle tooth and nail on every possession. Mind over matter guy who brings intangibles that don’t show up on the box score. Clutch performer who seems to shine when it matters most … A tremendous leader. Relishes the opportunity to take the club on his back and carry them to victory … Shows great consistency. Comes to play every game and had just a small handful of games where he didn’t score at least 15 points … While scoring is his forte, his ability to run the team and make plays for others, as well as maintaining above a 3-to-1 ast/to ratio is enough to label him a legitimate point guard … Has really evolved as a floor general, dictating the tempo and showing the patience to allow plays to develop and find teammates … A strong ball handler, though not elite level … Shows the ability to find teammates on drive and kicks … Tremedous in pick and roll situations … His numbers show how effective he is averaging 18.9 ppg, 47% from the floor, 39% from 3, 80% from the line, and a 6.8 to 2.2 a/to ratio … Validated his 3 point shooting ability by hitting a high volume (2 per game) … Has a surprising 6’5 wingspan, giving him some additional length to get shots off and finish at the rim … A pesky defender showing excellent ability to anticipate an opposing guard’s next move and get his hands in to strip the ball away … Shows solid body strength giving him the ability to stay on balance when contact occurs and finish off drives … Very effective in catch and shoot situations, playing off the ball … Also tremendous pulling up for shots off the dribble … ",": Undersized for the PG position and could struggle some to compete with bigger, quicker and more athletic point guards at the NBA level … Scouts worry that he may run into similar problems as 2011 top 10 pick Kemba Walker: having many passes deflected due to his size and having to work twice as hard (defensively and getting shots off) on a game to game basis due to his size. Can he be a starting PG, and if so can he do it on on a winning team? Due to being undersized, these questions must be asked … He doesn’t show the jitterbug quickness to gain separation on quicker guards which is a concern considering his size … Not the most athletic guard. Solid but not spectacular. Not a player that will dunk in traffic or be a dynamic finisher … His numbers show that he’s more effective in the half court than in transition … A better scorer than distributor, though his vision and passing ability shows flashes … Despite averaging 6.8 apg, scouts aren’t completely sold on his vision and ability to make everyone around him better … Needs to work on his pick and roll skills … As clutch a player as he is, his ISO ability is compromised by a lack of elite speed off the dribble and average first step … Much more effective going to his right. Will need to work on using his left hand and ability to go left in order for team’s not to overplay him to one side, limiting his effectiveness … Should look to add a tear drop to his arsenal. He won’t always be able to get shots off close to the rim, so adding an effective runner will help him when attacking the paint at the next level … ",6-1,190,PG,Michigan,So.,2013
CJ McCollum,": Combination guard whose game is marked by a lethal capacity for scoring … Averaged 21.9 points per game in 3 ½ season in Bethlehem … His off the dribble variety is elite—hesitation, rocker and crossover—excellent shiftiness and ability to burst through an open seam … He can score from anywhere, a truly unpredictable defensive assignment in the half court … Highly efficient in both isolation offense and the pick & roll, resulting in a score % of 49.2% and 45.7% as a senior in each respective situation … Renowned for his comfort level dribbling into a jumper from mid-range or distance; he’s also above 1 PPP shooting off screens and spotting up … He converted 33 three-pointers (52%) in 12 games last season … Hunts cheap points at the free throw line (6.7 attempts for his career, 82% accuracy) – has added 35-40 pounds since first arriving on campus and shows a proclivity for using his 200 lb. frame to draw contact … Capable of making appropriate in-air body adjustments following a bump … Plays with a palpable air of confidence; for every defensive design, he has the ability to counter … Cool under pressure in the deciding moments of the biggest games … Well-schooled and intelligent, operates like he’s seen it all before … Singlehandedly carried Lehigh to heights unforeseen. Plays well within the team concept, yet still possesses the one on one package to break away from it when necessary. 6’6 wingspan– major factor on both backboards (6.3 career, 7.8 sophomore) and creates absolute havoc in passing lanes (2.1 steals) … From a mental acuity and physical maturity standpoint, he’s ready. ",": McCollum will need to further cultivate his lead guard and team running skills at the next level … At this point, he profiles as more of a natural scoring, combo guard … At 6’3, his primary position will need to be at the point … 2.7:2.4 collegiate assist: turnover ratio spotlights his weaknesses in facilitating for teammates (as well as lack of a potent surrounding cast) … His most popular media comparison, Damian Lillard, averaged 4 assists per game his senior year … Lacks explosive quickness or leaping ability — solid athlete, but at least in part reliant on court craft and change of pace to make due … Three-point stroke could use fine tuning (32% sophomore, 34% junior), but mechanics look good … Level of competition is a legitimate concern. While he showed well against premiere programs (36 against Baylor and 30 against Duke), he was not tested consistently … He was essentially able to coast through Patriot League play and still dominate … Does not have great feet defensively or look fluid moving side to side- his ISO defense is a liability … Missed the final 19 games of 2012-2013 with a broken bone in his foot. McCollum will turn 22 in September. ",6-3,197,PG/SG,Lehigh,Sr.,2013
Michael Carter-W...,": High level passing ability … Tremendous length and height for his position combined with a high basketball IQ. Carter-Williams is a gifted athlete … He has the ability to handle the ball well for his size … Possesses the skill to burst through a first line of defenders, with a deceptive first step … Can turn a broken play into points with an outstanding ability to find the open man … Solid competitor … Rebounds the ball very well for a player at his position…Defensively, his length allows him to create turnovers at a high rate… Ignites the fast break, finding streaking teammates for easy dunks, trailing shooters, or finishes at the rim on his own, MCW can be a handful for opposing defenders … Was able to dominate running Boeheim’s offense at times, getting the ball to shooters in their spots, as well as lead the fast break, and create shots for himself … A true ball hawk with excellent anticipation and reflexes put him into the top 10 in steals …  ",": Ceiling is considerable, but so is his basement, has star potential but also appears to be a guy that could end up playing the majority of his career overseas … Already the age of a senior, so there is concern about his upside and how much his body and offense will improve … Routinely passes up open shots … His inconsistent outside shooting (29% from 3) will make it easy for opponents to sag off him, making it even more difficult for him to get by defenders … Battled inconsistency during his first full year as a starting point guard … Turnover prone. His youth showed at times … He needs to improve as a leader, a floor general, to become the player he can be at the next level … His upper body strength will have to improve … Needs to improve his outside shooting… Defensively, he will need to transition from Boeheim’s 2-3 to an NBA Man-to-Man … Takes a lot of risks defensively, can get away with it in college, NBA players will expose this … Was involved in a shop lifting incident at the beginning of the college season and while he was not arrested, the incident was documented and he’ll be forced to answer questions from teams about it. Character questions have arisen due to the incident … Credit Jim Boeheim and his system for making Syracuse players look good, but the track record of recent Cuse high picks (Wes Johnson, Jonny Flynn, Donte Greene, Dion Waiters(?)) has not been very good …  ",6-6,185,PG,Syracuse,So.,2013
Kentavious Caldw...,": Natural scoring ability (18.5 PPG) and effortless range (37% 3PT) in a classic shooting guard frame. He displayed massive improvement from freshman to sophomore campaigns. A more relaxed shooter in his second year, fully utilizing his foundation for better balance to spring into the shot. Solid elevation and consistent point of release. The trey is his layup. One-man show at Georgia — any possession where he found space to fire was a good possession. Pick and roll was usually the offensive set of choice. He delivered 1.03 PPP in 97 overall P&R possessions, and 1.275 PPP when running right side P&R. Highly efficient dribbling into a deep three or pulling up off a hard left drive. Posted a 58.8% Adjusted Field Goal Percentage in spot up opportunities and 50% off a screen. Quick release with catch and shoot in one harmonious motion. Got to the free throw stripe 5.3 times per game as a sophomore, up from 2.5 as a frosh (earned FT’s in 19.2% of transition possessions). High riser off of one-foot behind a head of steam. Outstanding top end speed. One of the top rebounding guards in the nation (7.1 REB) – very much committed to finishing defensive trips and optimizing his 6’8 wingspan. Elite defensive capabilities: gets into his man, moves well side to side, has the length to disrupt shots and plays passing lanes tenaciously (2 SPG). Defense into offense is his forte. Shooting specialist with size and defensive/rebounding skills is never a bad classification. ",": Caldwell-Pope’s repertoire is highly dependent on perimeter accuracy. Often takes the easy way out, settling for long range bombs rather than using his athleticism. 52% of his shots come from behind the arc. Smooth athlete, but lacks short range quickness or explosiveness — while he uses the dribble adeptly to buy space for jumpers (hesitation and step back), he does not possess blow by or shake up handles to get all the way to the rim. Attack needs to be encouraged. Adding strength would promote a more aggressive mentality as well. Does not serve as a facilitator with the ball in his hands, rarely aiding the cause of teammates. Posted a negative assist: turnover ratio of 1.8:2. Defensive prowess notwithstanding, he can be flighty at times and choose potential rewards over standard awareness; a trait not aided by his team’s inability to score. Combine notes: KCP excelled in the speed and agility drills (top-five in lane agility and ¾ court sprint), but flopped in maximum vertical (34.5) and standing vertical (29).  Adam Ganeles 6/6/13 Strengths: Caldwell-Pope is an offensive minded guard with very good upside as an off-ball scorer … Has nice size on the perimeter at 6’6 and seems to have good length and a frame that should easily be able to get to around 205-210 lbs without any loss of athleticism … Possesses very smooth athleticism and is pretty fluid in his movements … Has solid leaping skills and can play above the rim, especially with a head of steam … Offensively, Caldwell-Pope is mainly known as a shooter who will let it fly in any situation … Attempted 6.7 3’s a night as a Fr., which showed his freedom early in his career and it will probably allow him to be more confident next season for UGA … Has all the tools to be a very good shooting prospect for a team, with the size to get shots off, a high release point, and a reasonably quick release and steady follow through … Already has NBA range on his shot, and is best spotting up, but will shoot from that deep off the dribble and off screens … Shoots a pretty ball and definitely possesses a soft touch … Is a good mid-range shooter too, but he prefers the deep ball … Was a bit of a streak shooter as a Fr., but he is a constant threat with his shot to the D and must be guarded tight when he has the ball … Doesn’t do a bad job finishing around the rim for a guy who is mostly lauded for his potential as a shooter … Is a rangy strider and shows potential getting a step on defenders off 1 dribble to get his shots off … Has a lot of upside and confidence, and should only improve offensively with the experience he garnered as a true Fr … Is good at getting a good jump in the passing lanes to get steals … Pretty fundamentally sound defender who is competitive on that end … Very willing and effective rebounder for a wing player … Slightly more physical than he’s given credit for … Really looks likely to blossom in the near future as a player, solid worker and wants to improve … ",6-6,205,SG,Georgia,So.,2013
Anthony Bennett,": Bennett has expanded his game offensively and become almost unguardable during his first season of college ball … Bennett’s transition to the college game has been seamless … What grabs your attention about Bennett is his focus and intensity … Imposing physical specimen. Huge hands, wide shoulders and an enormous wingspan gives him great ability to dunk the ball with power … He’s very athletic, long, quick & fast. With a 7’1 wingspan & impressive inch vertical he poses nightmare problems in terms of mismatches … Able to overpower smaller defenders & bigger defenders get ""outquicked"" and often dunked on … Bennett is best at the power game in the paint, where at least 70 % of his scoring total comes from … When charting his shots on the season he has literally scored from every power spot on the floor … He favors the right side of the floor consisting of floaters, tip ins, reverse layups & dunks 60% of the time. Bennett’s 42 dunks put him among the country’s leaders. Bennett has made 23 3 pointers this season and averages 1 make per game. Bennett’s sweet spot is the left perimeter where he’s made 40% of his 3 pointers. His go to midrange move is his face up jumper from the right baseline … Two words that bode well for Bennett’s future are productivity and efficiency … He is so efficient that if he played 40 minutes per game he would average 26.2 points per game … He has the innate ability to create spacing which helps him to score whether it’s freezing a defender with a jab step or flaring off of a screen to catch & shoot or flat out blowing by a defender for a power dunk … Bennett continually shows his versatility which raises his intrigue … Bennett’s footwork is excellent, especially for someone of his size. Along with his footwork, Bennett’s shooting mechanics are very good. His form never changes on his shot. His shoulders are always squared and facing the basket. His release point is the same & even his misses look good … Bennett is extremely adept at drawing fouls and goes to the stripe an average of 6 times per game, knocking down 75% of his free throws … Bennett is an adept ball handler and has gone coast to coast 4 times this season. He maintains a low dribble and is rarely caught upright. Based upon playing 40 minutes, he averages only 2 turnovers. As stated earlier, with his tremendous skill set & ability to draw fouls he commands a great deal of attention defensively … ",": Somewhat of a tweener as he is slightly undersized for a full time PF (though that’s likely his future position) and slow defensively to play the SF position … The major concern for Bennett going into this season was his health. His prep career was marred with injuries as he was not able to finish out either his junior or senior seasons. On the positive side he hasn’t had any such problems in college having not missed a single practice much less game … There are some questions about his toughness. He’s got a massive frame with incredible strength, but for as big and strong as he is, it doesn’t always appear that he seeks out contact, or play with ferocity on the boards … While averaging a team high 8 rebounds a game, at times he appears disinterested defensively. In Bennett’s defense he spent the beginning of the season defending the opposition’s Center until teammate Khem Birch became eligible, but defending is also about desire. ",6-7,240,SF/PF,UNLV,Fr.,2013
Cody Zeller,": Bigman with an excellent basketball IQ and all around athlete … A gazelle. Runs the floor extremely well for a 7 footer. He’s also has great body control for a center, showing unusual ability to convert plays on the break … Plays with great energy, a focused and intense competitor … Highly unselfish, team guy and a willing passer with good vision for a big … Puts winning and his team over individual accolades … Fundamentally sound. Great feel for the game. Never seems to be in a rush and very deliberate with his moves … Shows solid ability to face up and knock down mid-range jumpshots … Displays good hands, rarely fumbles the ball … Good rebounder, good technique, anticipation, getting low and boxing out … A solid defender. Uses his size well to blanket opponents. Stays between his man and the basket and doesn’t gamble or bite on fakes easily … Hard working kid, who should only improve over time and become a very solid NBA player … Shows a willingness to battle in the post, and gets to the line at a good rate where he converts 75%, (averaging 5 of 7 per game) … Ceiling may be lower than some, but his basement is higher than most … Upperbody, while still in need of more strength has shown solid improvement in his 2 year Indiana career … Made a solid decision returning to Indiana for sophomore year as he enters the NBA with a better NBA body and overall readiness … In a draft with few sure things, Zeller will be a desirable prospect as a player with little bust potential … Was very successful matching up with Anthony Davis as a freshman. Showed confidence, and played him to a standstill scoring over him using great ball fakes, and helped IU get the upset victory over the eventual National Champions … Durable. Never missed a game in his 2 year career … Post game is solid, using good foot work and providing a solid target for post entry passes. Shows a solid understanding of the basics and just needs to develop more diversity to his moves … Has the size and versatility to play either the 4 or 5 positions … Should be able to come in and contribute immediately, which is more than can be said for most of the draft prospects this year … Doesn’t have any major holes in his game …  ",":  Not a shot blocker or much of a presence on the defensive end. Can be overwhelmed by stronger and more explosive opponents … While very composed, his moves can be too predictable, leading to blocked shots … Unselfish to a fault. May never be a huge scorer in the league … Seems to be more comfortable in a secondary role. Lacks an alpha male personality. As the team’s most talented player, it was clear that Indiana could have used a superstar, vocal leader, but he deferred to teammate Victor Oladipo, who assumed the role of team’s go to player and inspirational leader. Should look to be more vocal … Lacks great post moves. Surprisingly, his post game did not show the development in his sophomore season that many expected. Still has a lot of work to do to become an effective offensive player on the block … Should look to develop a go to move on the block … Humble to a fault. What makes him a solid player, patience and unselfishness, may also keep him from greatness. He lacks a fiery personality, and appears more comfortable being one of the guys instead of THE guy … Really struggled late in the year, particularly in the tournament. Syracuse’s length and 2-3 zone collapsed on him, and really limited his effectiveness. His athleticism appeared so ordinary, some wondered if he had an injury going on … Did not make the significant jump in productivity in his sophomore year, in fact, his field goal percentage fell of significantly from FR to SO season … Sort of a jack of all trades, master of none type …  ",7-0,230,PF/C,Indiana,So.,2013
Lucas Nogueira,": A project, but one with loads of untapped potential … His game has made some noticeable strides over the past 6 months … A high level athlete even by NBA standards with ridiculous size/length at 7′ feet, with a 7’6 wingspan. His combination of length and fluidity/athleticism makes him an extremely intriguing prospect … Quick reflexes … He even shows some touch around the basket and a decent offensive feel. While not much of an outside threat, his midrange game shows some ability and potential to develop … He’s best at scoring on garbage baskets and can get out on the break and finish … Seems to understand what he does well offensively and stays ""within himself"" … Solid rebounder. Goes after the ball on both ends and although his positioning could improve, he’s got natural rebounding abilities … Quick feet. From Brazil, and his footwork is excellent, a ""futball"" upbringing has given him excellent foot dexterity. Able to slide his feet laterally better than the average 7-footer … Solid hands. A 60% free throw shooter, which is not great but good for his age and position and should improve … As the 2012-13 season has progressed, his defense has shown some improvement. ",": Nogueira must become more intense defensively … Has a lot of defensive potential because of his size, but at this point he’s a huge defensive liability and would not see the court in the NBA because of it … Lacks basic fundamentals on the defensive end and either has not received basic coaching instructions, or is difficult to coach. His lack of strength, confidence and focus on defense is a glaring hole to his game … Needs to just relax and be more patient instead of trying to ""make plays"", his length alone should make him an imposing opponent but he routinely takes himself out of plays biting on fakes as well as getting overpowered … He does not appear inspired to play defense and has no idea how to use his length to his advantage by staying patient, on balance and just reacting to plays … His lack of strength is another major concern as he has a slight frame and gets pushed off the block easily … His feel for the game is still a work in progress … He doesn’t seem to understand what he’s capable of and forgets that he’s so much bigger and more athletic than nearly everyone he faces … Could learn to be a shot blocker over time … His body lacks strength but it appears that he could add enough muscle to at least hold his position in the post … He’s a 1992 kid, so at just 20, it’s important to remember that bigs take the longest to fill into their bodies and develop … Toughness, intensity and passion for the game have been knocks on him. He seems to be maturing mentally and physically the past couple of seasons … ",7-0,220,PF/C,Brazil,Intl.,2013
Sergey Karasev,": Sweet shooting lefty with a great deal of scoring acumen … Needs very little room to get his shot off, great at stretching the floor … Strong basketball IQ for a player who is yet to turn 20 … Has solid court vision/imagination and is a willing passer … Some ability to put the ball on the floor in the half court set … Shows toughness, fighting for rebounds, even with a lack of strength … Has spent the past year as a main scorer on a professional team with solid efficiency … Definitely seems to have a willingness to come over and play in the NBA, not much worry about a hold out … Will compete defensively and has nice size for either wing position … ",": Still relatively underdeveloped for the physical rigors of the NBA … Can be bothered by superior length and athleticism … An average athlete, this could really hurt him defensively on the pro level. Lacks great lateral speed making him a liability in isolation … Overall speed is less than ideal for a SG … Very inconsistent shooting from the midrange during his professional play … Spends too much time behind the arc and can fall in love with the long ball rather than mixing up his offensive repetoire … Will have to go through a drastic role change and culture change upon entry to the league … Needs quite a bit of time in the weight room before being considered as a rotation option at the NBA level ",6-7,197,SG/SF,Russia,Intl.,2013
Steven Adams,": Strong, big-bodied center with a lot of upside…Great length (7’5"" wingspan) makes him a terror on the defensive end and boards. Averaged 2 BPG last season in only 23 minutes per game…Hard-nosed big man who makes up for his raw post game by bringing energy and aggression to the court…Great bench press numbers (16 reps) indicate that he is already very strong, and should continue to add strength…Has a wide frame and an overall NBA-ready body…Very fluid for a man his size.  He runs the floor well and just seems to be comfortable in his own body…Uses his body to get good position in the lane…Very good rebounder thanks to his size and length…Expanding the range on his jumpshot.  Can shoot decently from at least 12 feet…Good transition big man…Efficient inside.  Shot 57% last year…Crashes the offensive glass with authority and gets a lot of put backs…Made a lot of progress in his one season at Pitt.  Appears to be a very coachable player and a hard worker…  ",": Has not played basketball for a very long time and is still an extremely raw big man…Has almost no consistent post moves…Doesn’t always use his strength like he should.  Often takes the ball up softly to the rim and gets blocked or simply looks overmatched…Was not a huge offensive threat in college, so he still has a ways to go to see a lot of playing time in the NBA…Is an extremely poor free throw shooter (44%)…Often looks passive on the court, and though he plays with a lot of energy, he often lacks the assertiveness he needs on offense…Poor footwork…Not much of a passer out of the post…Is still developing a feel for the game…His hands are big, but they aren’t very good, as he bobbles a lot of passes…Puts up a lot of very bad shots around the rim.  Needs to develop a softer touch…Still developing a consistent jump shot…Has a low free throw rate for a man his size…  ",7-0,255,C,Pittsburgh,Fr.,2013
Giannis Adetokoubo,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Nicolas Batum Strenghts: Athletic wing with a remarkable 7’3” wingspan of and incredibly huge hands … He’s still in the development stage and has grown three inches since last year … Standing 6’9”, he has amazing mobility and body control for a guy his height … He’s able to change directions off the dribble and with the ball in his hands with incredible smoothness and quickness, getting to the rim while maintaining excellent balance … His athleticism and wingspan make him able to cover 4 positions on the floor, showing great versatility … He has a natural feel for the game and a good basketball IQ, with good passing skills and instincts and the potential to become a point forward at the next level … Thanks to his big hands and his creativity, he’s an amazing ball handler for his position … He’s unstoppable with momentum, especially during secondary transition, when he can exploit his amazing mobility starting from the dribble … This year during youth games and Greek second division games, he showed the ability to start from one end after the rebound and go coast to coast and get to the rim with 2-3 dribbles, with incredible smoothness and speed … He shows good potential to improve as a shooter even if it’s his main shortcoming at the moment … On the defensive end he has great instincts in the passing lanes and in help situations, often with perfect timing for blocks from the blind side … With his physical tools he could easily guard opposing wings, showing the potential to defend both guards and power forwards, depending match ups. He’s still raw in many perspectives, but his ceiling and upside are the highest among the internationals of this 2013 draft … ",": His level of competition is a big concern, because it makes judging his talent and current level very difficult. Without question he has a large basement to go with his large ceiling … Despite his athletic abilities he lacks elite explosiveness … He has to bulk up, working especially in the lower body since he’s definitely too skinny to face NBA opponents at the moment … The concern is how to develop him correctly from the muscular standpoint, in order to avoid loss of speed and mobility (Boris Diaw) … His game off the ball is rather weak, especially related to spacing and use of screens and cuts, in fact most of his offensive production happens with the ball in his hands … The only exception is when he’s slashing to the basket for put backs or on the break … Plus he basically has no mid-range game, he tends to attack the rim without considering the option of the pull up jumper … He shot 31.3 % from three point line this year, showing good potential, but he lacks consistency at this point, his mechanics seems unnatural and not fluent … On the defensive side, he needs to learn the basis, since he’s beaten by the opponents due a lack of proper positioning and comprehension … The overall impression is of a raw prospect from basketball comprehension standpoint, whose is based on instincts, talent, physical gifts and natural feel for the game. For this reason he needs to be tested at a higher level of competition than Greek second division, since his level of experience is definitely low. ",6-10,205,SF,Greece,Intl.,2013
Dennis Schroder,": Point guard with effortless blow by speed to get by opponents virtually at will … At 6’1-6’2, he has a huge wingspan at 6’7 1/4 … Shows good form on his shot and his stats back that up, hitting 40% from 3 (on 3.3 attempts per game) and 84% from the line, averaging 11.9 ppg in 24 mpg during his season in the German Bundesliga … Solid passer. Vision and playmaking skills seem to be developing nicely … In the Hoop Summit he displayed a reliable handle and the ability to play under control at a high rate of speed, setting up teammates for buckets as well as an emerging pull up jumper. Granted that was against a talented but inexperienced group of high school prospects … A solid defender, showing a good understanding of spacing and staying in defensive position with his hands active without reaching. Displays a lot of potential to be an on ball pest with his quick feet and huge wingspan … Shows a developing tear drop and would be well served by perfecting it … Also has a deft spin dribble move … Schroeder’s elite level speed is his biggest weapon and gives him a lot of intrigue as an NBA prospect …  ",": Still raw, efficiency numbers this season could have been better … His 3.3 to 2.9 a/to ratio display his need to become a more efficient ball protector and distributor. Though it is important to keep in mind that he’s still just 19 … Despite his 40% 3 point shooting numbers, his shot appears to lack the ability to extend out to NBA 3 at this point, as he shoots a bit of a set shot … Just 168 lbs. Frame is slight so getting stronger will be important. At this point he can be easily muscled and knocked off balance by bigger and stronger guards. Narrow shoulders mean he’ll likely never be a physical player … Added strength would allow him to finish after contact and better utilize his ability to get into the paint. It would also benefit him defensively if opponents attempt to post him … Needs to develop the ability to go left. He is too right hand dominant making it easier to defend him by overplaying his right … Much more effective shooting from spot up than off isolation. Gaining the ability to go left would help in this area … Lacks experience playing against a high level of competition, having played this season with a low level German team (New Yorker Phantoms) with lower level Americans and Germans, and the team struggled (13-19) … Will need to develop into a vocal leader as a lead guard … Must become more adept running the pick and roll as a ball handler … Solid athlete but not a dynamic, above the rim type of finisher …  ",6-2,168,PG,Germany,Intl.,2013
Kelly Olynyk,": Legit 7 footer with a polished, highly effective post skill set … Prolific scorer on the college level averaging 18 ppg on 66 fg% in 25 mpg … Very comfortable operating on the block, using textbook positioning … Shows an excellent understanding of the game and has become one of the most dominant bigs on the college level … Has the ability to score on the block with up and unders, pump fakes, drop steps as well as knock down mid range and even outside shots … Solid in the open floor but more effective in the half court … Has decent agility, just lacks much explosiveness. He’s not a stand out athlete, but he does have considerable touch and coordination for a 7-footer … Can play out on the perimeter effectively, showing the ability to pass the ball and even handle the ball to get to the basket … Does a good job of using his body to shield defenders from the ball when going to the basket … Solid strength and rebounding ability … Unusually polished post skills for a college player. Gets a low base providing a big target. Seals off his man and holds his position after passes to set up easy buckets.

Although very quick, Green does not possess great jumping ability so will have to learn how to score around bigger and more athletic defenders … Seemed to focus more of his energy on offense this year opposed to defense, leading to less effective numbers on a per minute basis … Green has shown the ability to be effective when having the green light at all times offensively, but how much being relegated to a secondary role will affect his efficency remains to be seen … ",6-3,180,PG/SG,Virginia Tech,Sr.,2013

While some scouts are extremely high on him, there are just as many that question his focus and passion for the game … Often plays too upright on offense, which can get him off his base and lead to turnovers … Needs to work on moving without the ball, has a reputation of sometimes standing, ball watching … Defensive awareness is something he must work on, along with always running out to his spot and not relying completely on length, athleticism to challenge a player … Still needs to add upper body strength, had issues finishing around the basket and getting knocked off of his spot when defensive rebounding … Long range shot is still not overly consistent, sometimes turns his hand outward on follow through … Often loose with dribble, sometimes has the ball too high and gets exploited when double teamed … Some question his lack of assertiveness offensively, which calls into question his ability to be a primary option on a high level team … Battled inconsistency and struggled against physical defense, which could point to strength as well as a sign of shaky confidence … Should look to become a more vocal leader … Too often settled for long range shots and did not venture out of his comfort zone enough, still has many things to learn in terms of creating mid range shots and counter moves … Had a difficult time establishing post position, something that could be a crucial next step to utilize his quickness and size as a wing at the next level … Has been compared to Kobe Bryant, but the biggest difference appears to be the attention to detail. So far, granted Kobe’s is extremely rare, Wiggins has been lacking in this area. Will he develop this critical aspect in order to polish his all around game to achieve greatness?

Jabari Parker,": Parker is on another level from his peers, skill wise … Very strong, bulky forward with elite level face up game for his age … An underrated athlete; Parker plays a smooth, if not overpowering brand of ball, and  is more likely to muscle through opponents than blow by them … Possesses very good hands … Shows the ability to grasp nuances of the game … Has a passion for basketball, and this comes out in his play … A la Paul Pierce, is especially good at step back jumper, and can do it in both directions … Creates a ton of separation with his step back … Can go to work in the post, especially against smaller and weaker defenders … Will likely be developed as a small forward in the NBA, where he will immediately become one of the largest and strongest at this position … Work ethic is phenomenal … Really wants to be a leader; wants to be great … Even in high school, practiced with the focus of a pro … Has been a winner every step of the way of his career; won four straight Illinois State Titles in high school … Can create for teammates thanks to his high basketball IQ and overall play making ability … Commands so much attention from opposing defenses that teammates will find themselves with more opportunities to receive the ball in a position to score with him on the floor …  Can finish with both hands around the hoop … Solid, but not great ability to knock down the NBA 3-ball … Had some impressive dunks in his freshman season at Duke, which proved that he does possess the hops and explosiveness that he often does not get credit for … Also showed surprising body control and ball handling, weaving through defenders for finishes at the rim in the open floor …  ",": Defense and position are the two biggest questions with Parker … Some wonder whether he is quick enough to guard on the perimeter, or if he is long enough to defend the post … Has been given the ""tweener"" label that no draft prospect wants associated with his name … Appears to carry some extra ""baby fat"" … Somewhat slow release on the jumper, and it has a hitch; may need to tweak release to improve scoring opportunities against athletic defenders who match his size … Can he expand his range to be a reliable 3-point shooter? … Was asked to play in the post defensively for Duke, which may lead to an even bigger learning curve for Parker as he improves his understanding of how to guard wings in the NBA … Not a particularly crafty defender; surprising given how intelligent an offensive player he is … ",6-9,240,SF/PF,Duke,Fr.,2014
Joel Embiid,": The sculpted Embiid has a prototypical body for an NBA center, standing 7 feet tall, with a 7.5-foot reach, and weighing 250 pounds. He could use more muscle, but his frame should have no trouble bearing the additional bulk … Posted outstanding per-40-minutes numbers in his lone season at Kansas, averaging 19.4 points, 14 rebounds, and 4.5 blocks … An agile and mobile center, with nimble feet, good speed, great quickness, and vertical explosiveness … Excellent around the rim, scoring regularly on put-backs and alley opps.  According to Hoop-Math.com, Embiid made 76.3 percent of his attempts at the rim this past season…  His offensive game is still a work in progress, but the potential is there.  His offensive arsenal includes very quick drop-steps, jump hooks, and turn-around jumpers … Uses a variety of ball and body fakes to create space for his shot, including the renowned “Dream Shake.” … Draws a bunch of fouls (8.8 per 40 minutes), and makes a respectable 69 percent of his free-throw attempts … An active and aggressive weak-side defender …  Covers a lot of ground with his length and huge strides … Stats don’t tell the full story – on the defensive end, he alters a number of shots and is generally disruptive … Not timid – willing to put a body on someone and mix it up in the paint …  Sets solid screens … Doesn’t panic when double teamed …   ",":  Embiid had trouble staying on the floor, either due to injuries or foul trouble.  In a total of 28 games at KU, he played fewer than 20 minutes 10 times and more than 30 minutes only three times … Questionable durability – this past season, he missed one game (Feb. 15) due to a knee injury, played in the four following games, and then was shut down for the rest of the year due to a stress fracture in his lower back. He also dealt with lower back issues as a senior in high school … Averaged a whopping 5.9 fouls per 40 minutes at KU … Lacks both offensive and defensive awareness … Averaged 4.2 turnovers per 40 minutes at KU …  Defensively, he frequently focuses too much on the ball and loses track of his man … Was at times pushed off the block by bigger centers … Seems to get frustrated when not heavily involved in the offense or not making his shots.  At those times, his play appears to be a bit lackadaisical …  ",7-0,250,C,Kansas,Fr.,2014
Dante Exum,": The 18-year-old Aussie is a fluid and versatile athlete, who shows a great deal of potential … Good size for a guard, and should fill out nicely over time …  Excels at getting to the basket and drawing fouls … Finishes through contact and can score with either hand …  Excellent body control allows him to make very acrobatic shots at the rim … Opposing defenders are constantly off-balance due to his effective hesitation moves and explosive first step …  Moves well without the ball – makes good use of screens and does it at a relatively high rate of speed … Can create scoring opportunities for both himself and his teammates … Just scratching the surface in certain areas of his game – effective at making floaters, shooting off the step-back and posting up, but does not use these skills very often … Improving as an outside shooter – smooth and elevates well off the dribble … Very versatile – used at the 1, 2, and 3 spots … An active and alert team defender – his length and speed allows him to cover a lot of ground … Comes up with a lot of steals and loose balls … Does a little bit of everything, and is willing to do whatever is needed to win, including setting screens and mixing it up in the paint … A good kid – is coachable, affable, grounded, humble, and intelligent …  ",": Level of competition is the biggest knock against Exum. He has not proven himself against a high enough level of competition to make anyone feel completely comfortable drafting him in the top 5 … Some of his best performances have come in games (Under 19 World Championships) where he appeared to be one of the most physically advanced players … Playing for the Australian National Team, he was given free reign to create offense for himself. Can he be as succesful without being given the same level of freedom? … Exum has played off the ball a lot, and he doesn’t appear ready to be a true point guard … His handle is loose at times – has the ball poked away too often and occasionally fumbles when changing hands or directions … Not an exceptional facilitator – makes too many ill-advised passes … Inconsistent outside shot – does not always get enough elevation and has a low release point, especially when his feet are set (catch-and-shoot) …  Trajectory on his shot appears flat at times … Settles for long-distance threes too often … Not vertically explosive and struggles to finish with authority. For a player who thrives off of beating defenders off the dribble, his lack of ability to explode and finish with the best of them is concerning … Tends to drive to the left and shoot with his right … Struggles at the free-throw line, shooting around 65% in International competitions … Can he develop his body and become a tough player capable of finishing with contact?   ",6-6,196,PG/SG,Australia,Intl.,2014

Marcus Smart,": Strong, heady point guard with great size and instincts…Uses his mixture of quickness, strength, instincts, and aggressiveness to get to the rim, then uses his big frame and excellent body control to finish through contact…In addition to his scoring ability, Smart doubles as an excellent passer and playmaker.  He has great court vision and is willing to make the unselfish play to set up his teammates.  Averaged 5.8 assists per 40 minutes last season…Very sound perimeter defender who has the length (6’8"" wingspan), the strength, and the lateral quickness to keep his man in front of him.  Plays hard and harasses ball handlers into making bad decisions…Draws multiple defenders on his drives, then has the alertness to kick it out to an open teammate for a 3…Ball-hawking defender who averaged around 3 SPG throughout his college career.  Once again, his big wingspan helps him terrorize the passing lanes…His aggression and power allow him to get to the line at an excellent rate.  Shot over 8 free throws per game last season in just over 32 MPG…Great rebounding point guard due to his size and strength.  Averaged nearly 6 rebound a game last season…His height and his strength also allow him to post up smaller point guards and finish inside…Loves to get out in transition and has the vision and finishing ability to make him elite at running the fast break…Can play with guard position and can also defend multiple positions due to his size/quickness combo…Has a nose for the ball.  Will dive on the floor to get loose balls and will rip it out of the offensive player’s hands from time to time…Shows flashes of greatness in the pick-and-roll as both a scorer and a passer…Outside shot can be effective when Smart is on his game, making him a great inside-outside weapon…Makes winning plays.  His decision-making is excellent and he is great at balancing setting up teammates and making a scoring play himself…Raised his PPG (18.0 to 19.9) nearly 2 points per game in games against ranked opponents last season…Great motor and energy.  Puts it all on the line every minute of every game and always plays with intensity and competitiveness…Has that other-worldliness, always-in-control, do-what-it-takes-to-win, elite factor that a select few point guards (Kemba Walker, Trey Burke) in recent drafts have exhibited… ",": Not a great outside shooter.  Only made 29% from distance last season.  Needs to polish his mechanics and hit on a more consistent basis.  Struggles mightily on jumpers when guarded.  Release slowed by bringing the ball down to his knees before rising up and releasing.  Simply needs to be more consistent with his shot mechanics…Opponents will find it easier to stay in front of Smart because they don’t have to guard him as tight and respect his jumper…Not a very efficient scorer.  Needs to take smarter jump shots and not settle for pull-up threes…Could stand to be more patient and unselfish rather than forcing it and becoming dead-set on taking a shot at times…His assist/turnover ratio of 1.78 is not great.  Could certainly cut down on turnovers and be more patient on offense.  His aggression can sometimes be a weakness.  It also leads to offensive fouls on occasion…Mediocre ballhandler, another source of his turnover problems…Uses his physical gifts well, but ultimately doesn’t have great athleticism…Free throw percentage dropped from 78% to 73% between his freshman and sophomore seasons…Interestingly enough, Smart’s knack for making winning plays did not generally carry over to crunch time.  In 7 Cowboys games that Smart played in this season that were decided by 3 or fewer points or in overtime, Smart shot a mere 3/14 (21%) from the field in the final two minutes and overtime of those games.  He also missed several free throws in that span…Can be a bit of a ""flopper""…Smart’s teams have lost in their first game in the NCAA Tournament in each of the past two years, despite being expected to win both times.  The Cowboys also went on a big-time skid to end the Big 12 regular season, due, in part, to Smart’s suspension and inability to right the ship as the team point guard and star player…NBA scouts will have the Texas Tech incident fresh in their minds, when Smart lost his cool and shoved a fan, earning him a three-game suspension.  Smart doesn’t always maintain his composure, which can force him to make bad decisions both in and out of gameplay, and doesn’t always have a grey attitude or body language on the court.  This incident could have scared away a few teams at the top of the draft… ",6-3,227,PG,Oklahoma State,So.,2014
Julius Randle,": Very strong upper body and a reliable left hand … He shows a strong motor, and finishes well around the rim with contact … He is very skilled with his face up game and has shown some creative finishing ability … He is very dangerous on P&R and Pick and Pop, because of his ability to hit mid-range jumpers … Though he lacks elite explosiveness, he is able to use his strong frame to protect the ball and avoid blocks … On the offensive boards he is an absolute beast, relentless in seeking out rebounds … The same thing is true on the defensive end where he has natural instincts for rebounds … A pretty good post defender, he uses his strong body to not allow taller opponents to get close to the rim … He doesn’t have the quickest feet in the world, but definitely really good for a big, very balanced … Potentially he can switch on P&R situations for a couple of dribbles, but needs to improve on his showing … Randle is a mix of power, skills and balance that makes him a very interesting prospect … Despite being just a freshman he could have an immediate impact in the NBA due to his strength and offensive skills … He has drawn positive reviews for his attitude and coach-ability and appears to be a hard working kid that leaves everything on the floor every game and every practice … ",": Despite all the good things mentioned about his game there are a lot of concerns about Randle … In a way Randle’s high energy, ""bully ball"" style of playing reminds some of how Shabazz, at a different position, overpowered people last year and we’ve seen how much the former UCLA small forward has struggled in the league … It’s been noted that Randle is undersized for the PF position, lacking ideal length with a sub 7 foot wingspan … He may struggle to create looks against stronger, more athletic and taller opponents in the post … Offensively his numbers on synergy indicate how difficult it has been for him to score on post moves with very low percentages on each low post block and over either shoulder … It also doesn’t help matters that he is not able to utilize his right hand … Very few, even highly talented, players are able to play at high level without being able to finish and make moves with both hands, as the book becomes well known and everyone overplays their strength. I’m not sure if Randle fits this category, but the fear is there … His shooting isn’t consistent and despite good mechanics, his percentages are low and 3pts range is non-existent … He will have to develop a consistent solid jumpshot to replicate the success of Zach Randolph and Michael Beasley when facing the basket … Overall his game right now is based almost entirely on overpowering weaker opponents … He is very skilled but it will be hard to find the same success overpowering post players in the league. Also it is worth considering that most of Randle’s game is below the rim … His future will likely hinge more heavily than most prospects on landing in the right system, where a team has a vision of how to utilize him and makes sure he stays focused and works hard on the right skill development … A bad team or loss or focus could pose a huge risk to his NBA career … ",6-9,250,PF,Kentucky,Fr.,2014
Noah Vonleh,": Ideal PF size with very long arms and the skill set that had many envisioning him as a wing while in high school … Has shown flashes of potential to stretch the defense, as well as a rapidly developing post game, helped by his solid frame … Will not be 19 until August, which again brings to mind the potential growth his body and game could go through, along with the fantastic size and coordination he already possesses … Was a great rebounder during his freshman season, very aggressive on both ends of the floor hitting the glass … Gets out on the break and runs very well for his size. Shows very good mobility for a player with his size and strength, moves his feet especially well considering his thick, tree trunk legs … His combination of length, size and mobility made him a factor on that side of the floor, along with having major upside on that end with increased experience, awareness … Showed a good shot selection, shot a high percentage from the field and line, even showing ability out to three point range that could be developed down the line … Surprising ability to put the ball on the floor with decent mobility, along with range that should have defenders respecting his shot … Gets to the line fairly often and shot 71.3% FT as a freshman … Definitely passionate about basketball, has shown a will to improve and put in work … Cerebral kid. Is described as a gym rat, constantly looking to add to his game and made definite strides from senior year of HS to his freshman year of college … Though he is not an elite leaper, his length makes him a shot blocking and shot changing force … ",": The same youth and inexperience that makes him so intriguing might also mean a rougher transition to the pro game … Seems to lack a great feel and often appears to be ""thinking"" instead of just reacting and playing instinctively … Confidence is still an issue. Despite possessing great offensive tools, he took relatively few shots for a team banking on him to be a 2nd scoring option … Relies more on length than athletic ability, could also be questions about whether adding additional weight slows him down even more than it has seemed to since growing into the 4 spot … Needs work on his low post footwork, still adjusting to life as a PF as opposed to playing on the wing … On court awareness on both ends is still a work in progress, sometimes he lacks a bit of focus which could be attributed to lack of confidence and inexperience … Got into foul trouble fairly often, needs to play defense more with his feet than his arms … While his offensive skill set is tantalizing, some question whether he will develop the killer mentality that would make him into a viable top scoring option … Though his range projects to be a strength, he still needs work on being a reliable midrange and distance shooter … Turned it over quite a bit, which goes along with developing more court awareness ",6-9,247,PF,Indiana,Fr.,2014

Long arms also help him to get his shot off … Crafty, cerebral player who maximizes his athletic ability. Good at making adjustments during plays … Fiery competitor. Appears to lack a conscience and does not shy away from the limelight … Very smooth offensive game. Shows the ability to spot up for shots, as well as get shots off the dribble and has shown a solid ability to hit shots without much daylight … Improved considerably from FR to SO season. To his credit has worked hard to expand his game beyond just shooting, becoming a solid pick and role facilitator, even running the point during stretches in his sophomore year … Surprising leaper off of two feet and if he gets an open lane to the basket, uses his excellent length for some exciting two handed finishes at the rim … Ball handling is good for 2 guard … Has embraced the role of go to scorer and become the #1 option for Michigan this season … Solid a/to ratio shows good decision making and ball protection … Could fill the role of a 3 point shooting specialist, a la Steve Kerr, if his shot remains as effective from NBA 3 … ",": Although he’s viewed as more than just a shooter, his lack of overall speed could relegate him into being a one dimensional (spot up threat) pro … Not the most fluid of athletes. Lack of foot speed and overall quickness will make running defenders off screens to get open more challenging. This also affects his on ball ability to get by athletic defenders, and create shot opportunities … While his level of foot speed makes him very effective against college athletes, there is concern that he may struggle to find the same success against bigger, stronger, quicker athletes. Has been less effective when matching up against top shelf opposing guards. Lacks physicality. Gets pushed under the basket on drives easily. Has had a few games where he has been completely shut down (0-2 fg, 4 pts vs Duke) … Struggles on the defensive end against stronger and quicker opponents … Lack of foot speed hurts defensively … A good leaper off of 2 feet, but lacks a high level of overall run/jump athleticism and lateral speed … Body appears to be filled out, so how much stronger his legs and overall body can get are questionable … ",6-6,207,SG,Michigan,So.,2014

Zach LaVine,": Blessed with truly high level explosiveness, LaVine was one of the most intriguing prospects in college basketball last season … Shows electric speed and quickness, and is certainly one of the best leapers in the 2014 draft class … Really good body control as well … Pretty long … His upside as a prospect has a way of jumping out of the TV screen when you watch him play … Plays an exciting and fairly flashy style, and is a highlight reel dunker in the transition game … Is a magnet for run-outs, as his speed and acceleration allows him to generally be one of the first players down the floor after missed shots … Has a sweet looking jump shot, and his range extends past the NBA 3-point line … Also blessed with a swift (yet unorthodox) release and a strong ability to create space to get his shots off … Able to hit shots off of screens or off the dribble, making him a guy who must be accounted for no matter what on the perimeter … More than adequate ball-handling ability … Will be a tough cover due to his athleticism and shooting skills, as he can slash when crowded or stop and pop if the defender gives him space … Gets great elevation and has a high release giving him a great ability to get shots off … Has the ability to put up points in bunches … Already garnered experience playing as an instant offense threat off the bench in his lone year at UCLA, and that role will likely benefit him at the NBA level, as he gains experience … Would likely be most effective playing in an up-tempo system … Some think LaVine could develop into a combo guard at the next level, and he has the physical and athletic tools to do so … Shows finesse as a player, and is extremely fluid and smooth … A late blooming prospect, who wasn’t a highly touted recruit until midway through his Sr. season of high school … Could really just be scratching the surface of his true ability … ",": LaVine needs to develop more consistency and improve his basketball IQ … Has a tendency to settle for too many pull up jump shots and doesn’t attack the basket nearly as much as he should off the dribble … Got to the foul line at a poor rate for someone with his shot creating potential  last season (1.8 FTA per night on 69%) … Pretty thin and frail, needs to put on more weight … Not a physical player at all, and really struggles with any aspect of the game dealing with contact right now … Has a raw feel for the game, and decides to take some bad shots at times … Though he’s projected by many to be a combo guard, LaVine didn’t show a great ability to handle double teams and struggled some when pressured … Is a pretty underwhelming defensive player, and will have a tough time finding consistent minutes on an NBA team until he shows more effort and strength on this end … Doesn’t seem to be a very tough player. Body strength will obviously help his ability to play through contact … Though he has good shooting skills, his jumper faded badly down the stretch last season and rendered him pretty ineffective throughout the month of March … Struggles mightily to contribute when his jumper isn’t falling … Is a very promising prospect, but will need time to develop overall before he’s ready to play consistently in the NBA … ",6-6,180,PG/SG,UCLA,Fr.,2014
Gary Harris,": Harris is a very well-rounded 6’4 205 combo guard with a strong overall skill level … Unselfish, willing passer and does a good job of producing while playing a team-oriented game … Adequate athletic ability, and shows good fluidity and body control … Has a nice jump shot, and is confident with shooting as far out as 25 ft … Able to hit shots off the bounce, off screens and with his feet set at a good rate … Does a good job of making subtle moves off the dribble to get space for his shots, set defenders up looking for ways to score … Attacks closeouts well, and can get to the rim effectively when he uses ball fakes and misdirection moves to get a step on the initial defender … Can operate from mid-range, and seems to like doing so … Has good natural shot-making ability, can make jumpers when contested and delivered often when his team needs a key basket … Doesn’t play a flashy game at all, but is highly fundamental and pretty smart … Never has been a turnover prone player … Despite being a hair short of prototypical size for a SG, he has some ability to play occasional minutes as a lead guard … Good awareness, rarely is a step behind the action or asleep on plays … A very solid and well-coached defensive player, and will be able to defend both guard positions in the NBA … Shows the quick hands to get steals (nearly 2 spg as a Soph.), but also is a sound one-on-one defender who has active feet and textbook stance to effectively slow down penetration … Really looked a lot more consistent as a Soph., after a nagging injury slowed him down some as a Fr. … Pretty tough and competitive, proved he can play through injuries and isn’t one to back down from physical play, which was a must playing in the Big 10 … Has good skill level and is the type of worker that will make him a favorite of his coaches … Leads by example, and doesn’t have the kind of attitude that would be a detriment to a team … Will only be 20 when next season starts, has plenty of time to develop more as a player … ",": Despite having a reputation for being a cerebral, steady player, he took far too many ill advised shots in the ISO game as a sophomore … Harris is not an overly physically gifted prospect, and is going to be smaller than most NBA SG’s he will have to matchup with regularly … Also not overly lengthy (6’6.75 wingspan) or explosive for a SG prospect to compensate completely … Probably not going to factor very much getting to the rim and finishing amongst the trees, pretty vanilla as a creator when looking to slash … Won’t get a lot of finishes above the rim, though he will surprise at times … At times has to settle for tough jumpers because he doesn’t have the handle or speed to consistently break down a defense … Didn’t shoot as well as it may have seemed this past season (35% from 3), and shot more contested shots than he probably should’ve … Size/athleticism kind of limits what he can do on offense at the next level, will need to perfect some moves and use angles to create scoring opportunities … Can be hedged in pick and roll action by tall and athletic bigs, and can struggle with finding ways to clear the corner to score or make passes … Didn’t get much experience as a lead guard at Michigan State, which would’ve helped ease him into a role better in the NBA as a combo guard … ",6-4,205,SG,Michigan St.,So.,2014
Dario Saric,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Boris Diaw/Dejan Bodiroga Strength: At 6’10 it is very hard to find anyone in the world with the skills he possesses to play with or without the ball anywhere on the court … He can push it in transition as well as posting up with good results … His feel for the game is what really separates him from many other “Point forwards” … In Europe he can easily play as a 3 or 4 thanks to his court vision and decision making, very rare for a player of his height … Perhaps his 2nd greatest strength is his aggressiveness on the boards … He really is able to capture rebounds and quickly transform those rebounds in transition opportunity directly pushing the ball or making accurate outlet passes to teammates … Another really underrated quality of Saric is his IQ and understanding of spacing, on both ends of the floor. His development as a point guard early in his basketball career have given him a tremendous feel for the game … He is able to overcome his lack of athleticism many times being in the right spot in the right moment … Obviously his versatility is attractive to scouts, as he seems to have many ways to impact games, not having to rely on one skill … While his shooting mechanics need work, his percentages are much higher with his feet set … His determination and basketball IQ are really what makes him such an attractive prospect, and the hope will be that he can overcome his limitations through desire, hard work and dedication … ",": Saric would have a much better NBA outlook if not for his lack of foot speed and athleticism … His quickness and elevation might be enough to finish in Europe, but without the ability to finish above the rim, things will likely prove more difficult for him in the NBA … He is quick and mobile for a player his height but clearly lacks the foot speed to stay in front of NBA wing forwards … In addition he lacks ideal strength to battle NBA PFs on the block … He projects as a 4, despite his excellent face the basket skills, due to his size and lack of foot speed. Sort of a stretch 4 without great shooting ability … The best way to describe Saric’s game is a jack of all trades, master of nothing type … His lack of quickness will not allow him to beat anybody off the dribble 1 on 1, and the inconsistent shooting will not help in creating offense … In transition he will still be able to create but despite a good use of both ends his lack of explosiveness above the rim makes every lay-up very blockable …  3 turnovers per game are way too much for a player like him and it shows his lack of good decision making on a consistent base. In the NBA facing better athletes, it will be harder and harder for him to be effective in offense … Things get worse if we take a look at his shooting percentages. The mechanics are not one of a pure shooter, and he is making only 30% of his 3 pointers right now … With a longer NBA 3 point line it is safe to assume those percentages will not go up, though to his credit when he is in rhythm and his feet are set he can make around 40% at FIBA level … Defensively as we said, he struggles to defend both the 3 and the 4 positions. His wingspan is just 6’10 so he will be much harder for him to recover from his lack of foot speed … He does play really hard, and seems to have an aggressive mentality on every play but he will have to overcome many weaknesses and really develop as a player and as an athlete in the next couple of years to have a legitimate impact in the NBA …  ",6-10,225,SF/PF,Croatia,Intl.,2014
Adreian Payne,": An explosive big with shooting range to the college 3-point line … Shot a very impressive 42.3% on 3.4 3-point attempts per game as a college senior … Payne should be a quality ""pick and pop"" option in the NBA because of his toughness and shooting stroke … Very good free throw shooter (about 80% in his final two seasons at MSU) … He comes off as being a bit stiff in his movements, but is as explosive off 2 feet as they come …  A banger on the block.  Has decent post moves and a good stroke … Improving feel around the basket and in the post, especially when it comes to making a counter move and passing out of double teams …  Known to be an ""intangibles"" guy who is a good leader and hard worker … Physical.  Has toughness you’d expect from an Izzo coached player … Wiry strong — entered MSU with a slender frame but has filled out well … Appears to be the type of player that is even stronger than he looks … Really showed off his athleticism in the college dunk contest, where many agree he had the most impressive dunk of the event, doing a 360 while bringing the ball down to his feet mid-air before throwing it down with authority. ",": Though he has excellent physical tools, has not necessarily learned to translate his athleticism, along with his 7′ wingspan, into becoming a smart shot blocker due to poor timing on defense … Not a threat to create for teammates or make plays off the dribble …  Known to be a force on the boards, but rebounding numbers decreased (from 7.6 to 7.3 rpg), despite an increase in playing time, senior year vs. prior year …  Remains to be seen if he can excel in an up-and-down system … May struggle to play extended minutes — reportedly has reduced lung capacity.  Concerns over his lung capacity can probably be weathered by looking at the big picture; Payne projects as a role player, who would not typically be relied on for more than about 28 mpg — which matches his senior season average at MSU …  Takes a while to get set on his jump shot and has a tendency to bring the ball down to his waist to start his shooting motion, even if he catches the ball high.  However, he does have a high final release point … ",6-10,240,PF,Michigan St.,Sr.,2014
Jusuf Nurkic,": Standing at 6’11”, he has an amazing balance and mobility for the center position … He possesses a really solid and robust frame, almost 280 lb, combined with a solid 7’2” wingspan, so he’s well suited to banging in the post at the NBA level … He possesses excellent footwork which makes him really effective in pick and roll situations … soft hands and touch, he’s able to conclude with the hook shot in the painted area using both hands (even if he should improve the use of his left) after the spin move … A solid free throw shooter, a good weapon since with his frame he’s able to draw contact quite effectively … He plays with energy and intensity below the boards, he’s not scared of contact …Good rebounder. Defensively he has a great potential with his remarkable lateral speed and quick hands … He has a remarkable feel for the game and basketball instincts, with several of the offensive possessions of his team usually passing through his hands.  ",": He’s not a huge leaper or very explosive, his physical game is based on his strength so he could struggle against bigger and longer opponents on both ends of the floor … Even if he has shown remarkable potential on the defensive end, one of his biggest flaws is his tendency to be foul prone, due to the lack of discipline (fundamentals, positioning) and attitude … This combined with his temper and the consequent arguments with referees limit his utilization on the court to an average of 15 minutes per game … There are some concerns regarding his maturity and his behavior on/off the court … His game is basically instinctive, based on his natural talent, but he should work on his game comprehension, reducing turnovers and forced shots … ",6-11,280,C,Bosnia & Herz...,Intl.,2014
Kyle Anderson,": It’s not every season that the NBA welcomes in a 6’9"" point guard.  In fact, the comparisons to Magic Johnson have already begun for this kid…Has great floor vision thanks to his height and his instincts…Thanks to his size advantage over most of his match ups, he’s able to post up on smaller guards or throw entry passes right over their heads…Despite his lack of speed and acceleration (Anderson’s nickname is Slow-mo), Anderson is able to get past normal-sized point guards with his long strides…Great at leading the break.  FInds a lot of good looks for himself and his teammates in transition…Good outside shooter who has made massive improvements to his jump shot since his freshman year.  He’s shooting 50% from three this season and 50% from the field…HIs long arms make him a terror in the passing lanes at the point of attack.  He’s averaging 1.7 SPG…With 8.6 RPG, Anderson is perhaps the best rebounding guard in the nation…Has a 7’2"" wingspan…Great at using spin moves and head fakes to make up for his lack of speed and create a shot for himself…Has the size and skill-set to play three or four positions…Has great floor vision in addition to the ability to see over the head of his defender…A very intelligent player who knows how to set up his teammates and make good, pro-caliber plays… ",": Anderson is hampered by his lack of elite-level athleticism.  He has a below-average first step and lateral quickness…May find it difficult to defend smaller players when he plays guard…Still has trouble creating a shot for himself at times…Needs to add strength to his skinny frame as he often struggles to finish through contact…Has improved as a shooter, but still struggles with his shot from time to time… ",6-9,230,SF,UCLA,So.,2014
Shabazz Napier,": Napier is a gamer.  He has a knack for making big plays and raising his game against great opponents…This season, he’s become more of a distributor and has been less concerned with scoring.  His assist total has raised from 4.6 per game to 5.9… Excellent on-ball defender with great hands (2.1 SPG) … Has become a much more efficient scorer this year.  His field goal percentage has risen from 44% to 50% and, more dramatically, his three-point percentage has risen from 40% to 57% … An excellent rebounding guard, with 7 RPG thus far this season … Great at ""shifting gears"" with the ball in his hands.  He can blow by the average college defender with ease … Stat sheet stuffer.  Has become a legitimate triple-double threat this year with his increased rebound and assist totals … Deadly step-back jumper … Fearless. Confident. Plays with a swagger, truly believes in himself … Very good shooter coming off screens … Great finisher in transition … Solid free throw shooter (78% this season) … ",": Can be a bit of a ball-dominator at times.  Does a lot of dribbling … Does not have great athleticism or length (6’1"" with a 6’3"" wingspan) … This will limit his defensive ability at the next level … Streaky offensive player, although his shot has become much more consistent thus far in his senior season … Prone to forcing questionable shots, though he improved as a senior … For a player who drives to the hoop as often as he does, Napier doesn’t get to the free throw stripe that often. Only averaging 4.6 attempts per game this season … Assistant coaches at UConn questioned his maturity and leadership (off the record with scouts) early in his college career, though he has matured since … Will turn 23 a few weeks after the draft, older for a senior … ",6-0,175,PG,UConn,Sr.,2014
Tyler Ennis,": Extremely cerebral and unselfish point guard. Competitive desire to win and very team oriented … A clever floor general. Makes great decisions, mature, always under control … Has a great attitude, very coachable, has been described as a sponge … Quick first step, very good at changing speeds, and uses it well to get by opponents and into the lane … Good outside shooter, currently shooting 43% from deep on a high volume of threes … Aggressive defender. Gets a lot of steals playing the passing lanes … Great vision in transition. Often finds the open man halfway down the court … Can drive and finish with either hand … Good rebounding guard … Has been remarkably careful with the ball for a freshman point guard. Has no more than two turnovers in any of Syracuse’s games this season … Turns it over once every 26 minutes … Perfectionist. Shows a lot of attention to detail. At 19 years old, Ennis is still a very young prospect with many years of potential growth ahead of him. Being such a cerebral kid, there’s reason to believe he will continue to improve well into his mid / late 20s … 6’5"" wingspan helps make him the disruptive defender that he is and his wingspan helps make up for his mediocre height … Versatile scorer. Can make shots off the dribble or the catch-and-shoot at a high rate … Very mature overall player for being so young. He shouldn’t have too much trouble transitioning to the NBA compared to other players his age … Very adept running the pick-and-roll … Also shows solid ability defending the pick and roll …  ",": Lacks elite level speed and athleticism. Though he will at times surprise with both … Ennis gets a lot of steals, but he’s not the best or most fundamentally sound perimeter defender … Playing in Syracuse’s system, he will have to learn one on one defensive techniques at the next level … Has always had a cast of great teammates around him and could be less impressive when playing against defenders on par with his teammates … He’s a decent athlete and his IQ and instincts help him tremendously, but he’s ultimately not the most athletic point guard … Thin frame … ",6-2,180,PG,Syracuse,Fr.,2014
TJ Warren,": Warren is a big time scorer and a guy with fantastic instincts for the game … He works very hard on both ends of the floor and has a knack for finding openings in the defense to put the ball in the hoop, in other words, he’s very opportunistic … This ties in with his offensive rebounding as well, he always seems to be in the right position … He’s excellent in transition and runs the floor extremely well … Works well both on and off the ball … He can spot up and knock down jumpers from deep, he can set up his man and beat them via backdoor cuts or he can create for himself … He has range from all over the floor, although he’s best from midrange, and is surprisingly comfortable handling the ball … Lost some weight and looks more athletic this year … Will overpower lesser athletes around the basket playing bully ball … He is becoming more of a wing from a skill standpoint … Defensively he puts forth a great effort, and rebounds very well. ",": The obvious weakness is that he doesn’t have a defined position … He lacks athleticism at the wing, and he’s small for a post player with short arms … Regardless of where he plays he’s going to be at an athletic disadvantage due to poor lateral quickness and being a less athletic player … After shooting excellent from deep as a freshman, he has struggled from 3 this season, though his numbers have picked up as the season has progressed …  ",6-8,220,SF,NC State,So.,2014
James Young,": Young is a very talented scorer who can beat you in a variety of ways, his jump shot being the most notable. He’s very confident in his ability to hit from deep and can knock shots down off the dribble, while being tightly guard, coming off of screens or spotting up. His release is quick and he looks like a guy who could become an expert marksmen with time. Has excellent size for his position at 6’6-6’7 with a good wingspan and a 215 lb frame that looks like it could easily add another 10-20 lbs. With his length and more experience he could potentially become a fantastic defensive player. He’s a lefty and is young for his class so he could potentially grow some more. Crafty offensive player who finds ways to put points on the board. Plays with good energy. Excellent body control and finishes well through contact. One of the better rebounders at his position. Appears to have a good head on his shoulders and is a functional passer. ",": At this point doesn’t have a go-to skill that sticks out. He’s merely good in most areas as opposed to great. His jumper is still streaky and he has a tendency to take some bad shots early in possessions. Not a special leaper and lacks a degree of quickness which means he may be more of a small forward than a shooting guard. Despite his frame he could still add a good deal of strength. His ball handling needs tightening as he’s usually most effective only utilizing a few dribbles and his right hand needs work. Lack of driving ability renders him somewhat one dimensional offensively, if his outside shot is not falling he can shut down. Lacks a lot of experience at this stage and it shows defensively with his gambling. It also shows up in his decision making at times and it’s hard to grasp how great is basketball IQ is at this point. ",6-6,215,SG,Kentucky,Fr.,2014
Jordan Adams,": His greatest attributes are his scoring ability and competitiveness … He is a player who really wants to win and will sell out for the team … Many scorers’ use the defensive end for 35 seconds of rest time, or don’t crash the boards hard … Adams instead seeks an opportunity to score at all time … While on defense he is great in anticipating passing lanes and jumping them to get out on a fast break … He always sprints to the offensive half court to find easy points … On offense he crashes the paint using his big body to finish around the rim … He is also a master of cuts, exploiting his teammate Anderson’s ability to create from the dribble. Adams often back cuts behind his defender for an easy layup … Despite being a scorer, Adams doesn’t dislike passing the ball, finishing the season with more than two assists per game … Perhaps the most effective part of his game is his mid-range game which is reminiscent of Rip Hamilton (though much different body type) … Adams does a great job in reading his defender on screens for jump shots (Alford work with him on reading screens certainly helped him improve this part of his game) and is great in using his strong upper body to put his defender ""in jail"" to finish with floaters or around the rim, though he is not exactly an top athlete … He also has really good post moves for a guard, often taking advantage of smaller guards to score or get fouled … ",": As noted Adams isn’t a great athlete. He doesn’t necessarily needs to be a great athlete to succeed in the League, but it will for sure make his life harder when he will have to score in the paint … I’m not sure that he can finish so easily over NBA bigs, he will have to take his mid-range game to an even higher level … And it will make his life a lot harder on the defensive end where he will have to show the ability to stay in front of his opponents … His lateral speed and foot speed aren’t where a NBA coach would like to have it but the strength of his upper body could help to handle the contact … The other knock on his game is how inconsistent he is as a 3pts shooter and particularly on close out situations … According to synergy in those situations when the defender is recovering on him he tends to shoot 81% of the time with very low percentages: 28%, well below average for a guard and clearly not the numbers you would expect from a player like him … He needs to become a much more consistent shooter or decision maker on close outs to be successful in the NBA, where particularly initially he will have to take advantage of those opportunities to show his value before having screens and plays run for him … ",6-5,209,SG,UCLA,So.,2014
Glenn Robinson III,": Tremendously athletic small forward who plays with a lot of energy … A great above-the-rim offensive player, Robinson is on the receiving end of many a lob pass … Ambidextrous. Can drive either direction with either hand …  Finishes strong at the basket, as well … Good NBA body, standing 6’6"" with a solid frame and a 6’9"" wingspan … Good at probing the defense for holes and finding a driving lane to the basket … Runs the floor well and can be a terror in transition … Good lateral quickness and long arms makes him a solid perimeter defender … Attacks the offensive glass and scores on a number of putbacks and second-chance tip-ins … Has great defensive instincts which, along with his long arms, allow him to jump the passing lane and take the ball the other way for an easy finish … Solid shooter from midrange. Shot 49% overall, which is a testament to his efficiency and patience on offense … Doesn’t force things on offense, but when he chooses to attack, he does it with aggression and commitment … Good free throw shooter.  Shot 76% this season. Appears to be a better shooter than his numbers showed based on his form and shooting in practices … Played for a pair of Michigan teams that made deep runs in the tournament … ",": Can sometimes be too passive on offense … Often seemed content to play a secondary role to Nik Stauskas and Mitch McGary (and even Caris LaVert) while at Michigan … Decent, but not great outside shooter … Needs to gain consistency to shoot from behind the arc at an NBA level … Doesn’t always get his feet set when shooting from distance … Shot 31% from 3 this season. An unexpectedly low number considering his shooting ability … Robinson is still maturing as a player.  He’s only 20 years old and often has the mental lapses or losses of concentration that come with that … For being such a tenacious offensive rebounder, Robinson doesn’t exert the same effort on the defensive glass.  Averaged only 3 defensive boards per game this season … Often needs others to set him up to score … Should look to tighten loose handle.  Needs to protect the ball better when it’s in his hands … Can often get overmatched and bullied by bigger forwards, both on the perimeter and inside, but doesn’t have the quickness to play the 2 … Has a poor rate of drawing fouls.  Averaged little more than 3 free throw attempts per game this season … Sometimes he just needs to focus more on making the fundamentally sound play than the game-changing/highlight play … Didn’t quite make the level of improvements he was expected to make after his freshman year, though he certainly did show development … ",6-7,211,SF,Michigan,So.,2014
Jordan Clarkson,": Quick guard with good size who has displayed point guard ability … Ran point the majority of the time during his lone season at Missouri … Has a strong handle and displays solid vision … Has the ability to post up smaller players and still has quickness to create off of the dribble … Athleticism also allows him to take advantage of bigger defenders, can shoot over them off of the bounce or take them to the basket … Can score from all three levels and is able to create his own offense … Gets low on both ends of the court, moves quite fluidly … His lateral quickness and size gives him potential as a defender, could be versatile guarding the perimeter … Excels at pulling up off of the dribble, giving him the potential to develop a floater as well as spot up ability … Got to the foul line fairly often, shooting 83.1% from the stripe, which would lead many to believe he has a lot of potential from midrange … Has displayed some outside shooting ability. He can be streaky in a good way at times … Used to playing big minutes, and is in excellent condition … Really good body control, use it to create space for opportunities and finishes well around the basket… Decent rebounder given his position, aggressive around the ball … Provides versatility at the guard spot, size and length to defend multiple positions … ",": Struggled shooting from the outside this past season, only shot 28.1% from 3PT range … Move to the point was not a flawless transition, struggled running the team and not a natural distributor … Did not end the season strongly when his team was fighting for a possible NCAA tournament spot, shot under 40% from the field in 8 of his last 9 games … Going to his left is not a strong suit, needs work on his off-hand … Committed a lot of turnovers, his assist to turnover ratio is not ideal for a PG prospect … His defensive awareness is still in raw stages, despite his physical ability and athletic awareness, was not statistically efficient on that end of the floor … Still needs to add strength, has trouble with physical defense which can affect him near the rim … Despite his ability to drive and penetrate, was not the most prolific finisher close to the basket … Shot selection can use some work, which is where being streaky can work against him … Still a bit of a hitch in his shot, needs to iron out his mechanics … Left hand needs work, gets into trouble when being forced to his weak side … With the ball in his hands so often at Missouri, there may be an adjustment to playing off of the ball, working as a cutter, though he certainly has an ability to improve in this aspect … ",6-4,186,PG/SG,Missouri,Jr.,2014
Jarnell Stokes,": Stokes is a powerful power forward who is a load to stop on the low block … Great at establishing position around the basket, which is reflected by his 53% shooting from the field this past season … Great rebounder for his size; averaged 10.6 RPG last season … Plays with a high motor and crashes the boards/boxes out tenaciously … Plays with a high IQ and has a good team-first attitude for a guy trying to make it in the league … Great touch around the rim.  Very efficient finisher in the post …Very difficult player to back down in the post … Gets to the line a fair amount.  Averaged over 6 free throw attempts per game this season, where he connected at a rate of 70% … Rarely has an ""off night"".  Recorded 22 double-doubles this year … Gets up and down the floor quickly in transition …Decent jumper from out to mid-range … With a 7’1"" wingspan, Stokes has fantastic length … Good at using a few quick dribbles to get around his man in the paint … Great hands … Has gotten more comfortable playing away from the basket this season on both ends of the court… ",": Undersized from a height standpoint for an NBA post player, although this can be alleviated some by his wingspan, strength and motor. Appears around 6’7 to 6’7.5 in shoes … Will struggle to defend face-up 4’s on the perimeter due to his below-average lateral quickness…Somewhat limited offensive game, but he does contribute a lot in other areas…Until this year’s postseason, Stokes’ teams at Tennessee always seemed to under perform… ",6-8,260,PF,Tennessee,Jr.,2014
Cleanthony Early,": Early is a versatile combo forward with a natural inclination for scoring (16 PPG) … He’s a terrific athlete at 6’8 with clean movements, good quickness and explosive vertical bounce … An active mover without the ball, he uses that athleticism to slash & finish around the bucket … While offensive rebound output is down (2.3 to 1.4), it’s unquestionably an area he can impose his presence … Early is comfortable receiving the ball with his back to the basket where he can elevate over defenders (high release) or utilize a quick spin baseline … He’s advanced his shooting range – 1.7 makes and 3.5% jump in accuracy – but still a mid-range weapon first and foremost … 85% free throw shooter. No apparent fundamental flaws in his release, but does bring the ball from low to high … Most effective off catch & shoot, can serve as floor stretcher off pick and roll … He’s playing with improved confidence and game in, game out consistency as a senior (two single-digit efforts, both in blowouts) … Possesses all the tools to be a solid perimeter defender when fully engaged; moves well laterally and doesn’t gamble … Product of a winning program and coached up right by Gregg Marshall … Early raised his game under the bright lights of the Final Four, posting a 24/10 (zero turnover) line against Louisville’s elite frontcourt. ",": To occupy the 3-spot at the next level, Early needs to beef up his off-the-dribble dimension … Ball handling and willingness to attack are on the incline, but he’s far from secure … He avoids dribbling into tight quarters and creativity is lacking … Not the best decision maker with ball in hand (2 TO); lacks a feel for passing. Range shooting is steadier at 35%, but he shouldn’t be attempting 5 three’s per game in college. At 220 pounds (tops) with a 6’9 wingspan, defending against NBA 4’s is a bit of a pipedream … He’s bulked up some since arriving from JC – particularly core and lower body strength. More hard yards are required in order to stand firm in post defense … Tendency to get caught watching the action (when not the primary defender) is disconcerting. Awareness and focus can be suspect. Early has a plethora of skills, but a few major limitations have earned him the label of tweener … He’ll turn 23 in April putting a cap on his physical upside. Nevertheless, as Wichita keep winning, Early keeps climbing draft boards.  Adam Ganeles 2/17/14 ",6-7,210,SF/PF,Wichita State,Sr.,2014
Jerami Grant,": A very athletic forward prospect with top notch physical tools … Projects to be a wing, and has good size for the position at 6’8, and possesses outstanding length to match (7’2 3/4 wingspan) and a massive 8’11"" standing reach  … Has a good frame to add weight without the loss of athleticism, and should be an amply sized wing as he inevitably gets bigger … Runs the floor exceptionally well, and is a long strider with good speed and high level leaping skills … Gets off the floor quickly … Covers tons of ground every times he moves … His size and athleticism could allow him to be a Swiss army knife on the defensive end of the floor, as his length and lateral quickness are both tantalizing for a forward … Was pretty good and sound as a defender in the back of Cuse’s 2-3 zone, which bodes well for teams who wanted a clearer read on his ability to adjust to traditional NBA style defense … Nice pick and roll player … Is a good finisher around the rim and gets a high number of dunks … Able to “get skinny” around the rim to finish around defenders … Has some effective finger rolls and scoop shots … Is tough to stop from getting to the rim off the bounce from the foul line …Will be a hard cover for PF’s because of his quickness and ability to attack off the bounce inside the arc…Is generally effective without having many plays run through him … Moves well without the ball and is adept at cutting to the basket for easy baskets … Good offensive rebounder and will get put back dunks if the defense doesn’t box him out … Plays with energy and a good motor, and is willing to put his body on the line for loose balls … Got to the foul line at an extremely impressive rate last season, which speaks to his aggressive nature as a slasher … Has considerable potential as a player, and his ability to continually improve will be largely based on simply putting on pounds which shouldn’t be that hard for him to do … Was on Team USA’s U19 World Championship team this past summer (put didn’t participate in the actual game due to mono), and was applauded for his defensive efforts in practice sessions…Has promise, and will not be 21 years old until near the end of next season … Has relatively limited wear and tear, as he only played extended minutes this past season at Syracuse … ",": He could have some struggles to find a true position, especially initially in the NBA … Obviously needs to put on weight, and even though he has since HS it has been a fairly slow process and improving his thin body will have an impact on his NBA career … His perimeter skills are a bit underdeveloped, and he shows below average handles and a nonexistent jumper from deep … Pretty predictable off the dribble, and very rarely goes left … No good from anywhere outside of 12 feet as a shooter, and he made 0 3 pointers as a Soph. … Has an awkward release that needs to be overhauled completely … Though he has real good defensive potential and put together some strong defensive performances in college and the World Championships, adjusting his instincts from Boeheim’s 2-3 zone to a largely man to man system will likely take a little time … Showed some raw instincts at times on defense in college …Was not nearly the type of shot-blocker or playmaker on defense his physical tools suggest he should’ve been this past season (0.6 bpg and 0.8 spg) … Reliant on teammates to produce offensively and generally is ineffective when his guards struggle, which happened often down the stretch for Syracuse … Has virtually no post game for a guy who played extended time at the PF spot and projects to play some minutes at PF at the next level in small-ball lineups …Rarely passes the ball … Still is a pretty green player, and has some learning to do before he reaches his potential as a player … ",6-8,214,SF,Syracuse,So.,2014
Clint Capela,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Ian Mahinmi/Amir Johnson Strenghts: Capela is as good as any athlete ever coming from Europe … What really separates him is his explosiveness around the rim … He isn’t scared of contact and can really finish above the rim with one of two hands … He also can really run the floor on finding easy layups and dunks in transition … Capela is still a very raw talent with a lot of upside, but has also developed solid instinct, particularly on the defensive end … He also makes passes you would not expect from a player like him … His ability to finish around the rim is pretty good, which makes him a very dangerous player on Pick and Roll situation and circling around the basket … Defensively he is very quick, with good lateral movement and when locked in he can really be aggressive showing on pick and roll but also in switching situations … In a good day he can be absolutely dominant in the paint at the European level, and with focus could become an above average NBA defender over time … ",": The biggest knock on Capela is his lack of basketball IQ … He frequently appears lost and often wants to make plays without understanding what is going on around him … He also should be an absolute monster due to his physical attributes but can lack aggressiveness on both ends of the court … Instead he shows laziness, playing behind opposing big men in the post when he should fight to deny entry pass or simply not getting into a low defensive stance on the perimeter … In addition his defensive technique on the block lacks fundamentals, many times two dribbles are enough to push him under the basket and finish over him … For a raw, very unskilled player like him, at this moment of his career, effort should always be stellar to compensate for his weaknesses … Too many times he is lazy on P&R situations, on calling the screens and even on running back on defense … Another very evident problem is his lack of strength around the basket where, even with his apparently very strong body, he is far too easily pushed around by much smaller opponents … He does not get enough boards, considering his great size and athleticism, his lack of technique hurts his productivity considerably … You can get away with that in the French League, but not in a League where players like Kenneth Faried would literally go around him every single time on the offensive glass … On the skill side there is obviously a lot of work to do … His shooting mechanics need to be rebuilt from scratch. The same is true for his post moves, where he has shown quickness and the ability to go over both shoulders but lacks a true go to move. Has the physical tools, but needs to be smarter, more focused and play hungrier for the entire 40 minutes … Offensively he must use his strength to make deep catches in order to finish until he will build a reliable offensive arsenal … ",6-11,222,PF/C,Switzerland,Intl.,2014
Bogdan Bogdanovic,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Jiri Welsch Strenghts: Standing 6’6” he has a perfect size for the position … With his solid structure and athletic abilities he can definitely adapt his game to the NBA level, with the potential to defend both on guards and small forwards … He possesses natural game comprehension and poise which allows him to play the role of offensive facilitator and game distributor (4 assists of average thus far) … During this season he started playing as a secondary ball handler, but after the injury to Leo Westermann he has been forced to play as a point guard, showing remarkable passing skills and court vision, even if he’s not perfectly suited for the role … He has a slashing style of game, and with his solid structure he’s really effective in drawing contacts when attacking the basket or posting up other backcourt players, exploiting his size and physical strength … This combined with his instincts allow him to also be a reliable rebounder and a consistent defensive presence … On the defensive side he shows great attitude and quick hands, with the ability to put a concrete pressure on his opponent especially in 1vs.1 situations … He’s also effective in the passing lanes, with almost 2 steals per game this season … He has constantly improved his game since his debut at the senior level, becoming an ideal glue guy for a contending team … ",": He lacks elite explosiveness, especially when he has the ball in his hands, which limits his ability to create his own shot from the dribble in ISO situations … Lacks a quick first step, needs screens and off the ball game to create space to beat his defender … He’s still stuck in the middle of two roles, since he lacks elite playmaking skills, as well as remarkable scoring instincts, and this could limit his NBA appeal … Solid ball handler but his decision making is affected when forced to play against press defense … His shot is still not consistent yet, especially his pull up jumper in pick and roll situations, he’s a streaky shooter and he could encounter scoring slumps … He’s not the kind of player that’s able to change the rhythm of the game coming off the bench, and this is in contrast with the role he could be requested to play at NBA level ,,. On the defensive side he has poor lateral speed, he tends to struggle against quicker and smaller guards … ",6-6,205,SG,Serbia,Intl.,2014
Karl-Anthony Towns,": Center prospect with the size and skill set to make a strong impact at both ends of the floor in the NBA … Hard worker, smart kid, with strength of character … Shows desire and a competitive nature … Possesses a great feel for the game … Offensive game oozes potential with a text book shooting form, great touch and ability to hit outside and mid range jumpers effortlessly and consistently … Has even implemented a steadily improving hook shot into his repertoire … His length and strong body gives him excellent ability to rebound and hold position in the post … Tremendous rebounder on a per 40 minute basis, with big hands, good box out fundamentals, post positioning and energy … Has worked hard on his body and has developed broad shoulders and good strength … Should be able to add additional weight and play comfortably in the 260-270 range … Shows a willingness to play physical and fight in the post … Terrific passer, good vision, he’s able to find players when doubled, and even have the offense run through him at the high post … Very good shot blocker. Though not a huge leaper, has excellent timing and shows the ability to use his great length as a rim protector … Shows better speed than quickness, and can really motor once he gets a head of steam … Hustles and shows the willingness to defend and play hard … Underrated foot speed and perimeter defensive ability … Doesn’t seem to get winded easily, though the UK platoon system helps in this area … Has shown the ability to defend players much smaller than himself with success on the perimeter …  ",": Has struggled mightily with his post offense early in the season. Post play, foot work and confidence on the block needs a lot of work … Still appears to be growing into his body, movements are gangly … A very solid athlete, but not the most explosive leaper without momentum, though he’s shown the ability to dunk from the free throw line, so he’s not exactly a plodder … Second jump leaping not a strong point … Appears to leap better off of one foot than two which is better for wing players … Huge feet seem to weigh him down some and challenge his ability to make quick moves from a standstill position … Has shown a tendency to get in foul trouble and the current ""platoon system"" at Kentucky does not allow scouts to accurately judge his ability to play full games and stay out of foul trouble … Has a lot less pressure to produce on a daily basis on a stacked UK team. It’s easy to look good when teams are not able to focus all of their attention on a player the caliber of Towns. Coach Calipari’s system also does an excellent job of showcasing a player’s strengths while masking their weaknesses … Top heavy. Despite showing a huge set of arms and shoulders, his lower body strength needs work, as he gets knocked off balance and pushed around at times. Balance can improve. Granted, considering his age and work ethic, these are not hugely concerning issues …  ",7-0,250,C,Kentucky,Fr.,2015
D'Angelo Russell,": Precocious point guard with tremendous ball skills … Intriguing long term prospect considering his package of attributes … Smart, and smooth guard who never seems to get rattled or rushed into making mistakes … Shows great poise and maturity for a freshman. Makes everything look easy … Great imagination and creativity. His vision and passing ability is very intriguing … Excellent decision maker and appears to have the ability to develop into a point guard for the next level … His drive and dish already is an effective element to his game … 6-foot-9 wingspan gives him the ability to disrupt passing lanes and shots, as well as giving him extra length to get to loose balls and get shots off … Shows good form on his shot and a quick release. Connecting at a good rate on shots at all 3 levels through the early part of the season … Very good at running the pick-and-roll, well ahead of most guards at the same stage in that element … Very good at creating shots in the midrange with a nasty handle, using crossovers and fakes to rock defenders off balance … Conditioning and confidence in his first year have both been impressive … Has worked on his body and is showing better upper body strength …  ",": Still unproven as point guard, so the question is how long it will take him to become effective and productive on the NBA level at the lead guard position … Not a bigtime athlete. His length helps him to defend but he’s a below average run/jump athlete by NBA standards … Needs to develop a better intensity level at the defensive end … Shot is good, although he may need to tweak his release slightly, in order to extend his range out to NBA 3. He tends to turn into his shot slightly, and should work on ironing out his form … Also needs to sustain a level of consistency through an entire college season … Has trouble finishing in transition, change of speed and added strength (particularly his legs) would help this tremendously, lack of explosiveness has hurt his efficiency in this area … Like most young guards, can use some work on his off hand and shot selection … Decision making is good, but a bit turnover prone at this stage … ",6-4,195,PG/SG,Ohio St.,Fr.,2015
Jahlil Okafor,": One of the most advanced low-post scorers the college game has seen in quite some time … Huge frame with strength that helps him establish post position on a regular basis … Gigantic, soft hands, looks like there is a volleyball in his hand at times … Post footwork is excellent for a player his size, very quick on his feet when he is close to the hoop … Feel for the game is excellent, tends to make his move as soon as he feels contact and can go over either shoulder, baseline or middle … Double teamed constantly, has a nice ability to dribble out of it without getting trapped and is a solid passer out of the low post … Legitimate center size, 6’11 with an approximate 7’5 wingspan, making him that much more difficult to stop, while making him at least a difficult presence to shoot over at the basket … Played 30.3 mpg, really seemed to work on his body and ran quite a bit better than he did in high school, his conditioning has not been as much of an issue as in the past … Very soft touch around the basket while getting quite a few shots, has shot an incredible 66.8% FG … While he is not an explosive leaper, his improved conditioning has given him more lift and really helped him run the floor and be part of the transition game … Difficult to keep off of the offensive glass, plus very dangerous when given second shot opportunities … Has potential to be a factor in the pick-and-roll, definitely someone difficult to stop when he has some momentum going to the basket … Very difficult to defend one-on-one, constantly draws attention from the defense down low, leading to a lot of open looks for perimeter players …  Draws a lot of fouls, had nearly 100 more fouls drawn than committed … Strength to go through contact … Has appeared to be quite coachable, plus while he does display intensity at times, never really seems to lose his cool ",": While his conditioning at Duke was a great sign, he is the type of player who will need to work on this constantly and can still tone his body to maximize his athletic potential … Lacks great lateral quickness and is not an explosive leaper … Could be much more of a presence as a defensive rebounder, will miss box outs and find himself out of position … While he shows a soft touch near the hoop, has struggled from the FT line for a majority of the year, only shooting 51.1% FT … Not a player that will stretch the floor, which some consider a downside as far as where the league is headed … Can struggle against length and athleticism, will have a much tougher time creating offense in the post … Struggled defending the pick-and-roll at times, will be that much more difficult in the NBA … Even if he did have a really high number of possessions used, his turnovers numbers were quite high, will be something to work on … His effort level has been under a microscope at times, some wonder whether he goes hard every possession … Lack of athleticism will hurt on defense, which might not make him the most ideal “franchise big man”, hard to name players who have had successful teams around them who have struggled defending the post … Foul trouble was not a major issue, but it might become more of one upon facing pro speed … Not a natural shot blocker, usually gets blocks with length alone and rarely leaves his feet, not an ideal rim protector … While he got fouled quite often, he really did not take as many FT’s as one would think, possible reluctance to get to the line? … Post skills are fantastic, though adding a nice bank shot or hook shot might be an area of focus to further diversify his offense ",6-11,270,C,Duke,Fr.,2015

He’s been seen getting in the face of teammates when they don’t play up to his expectations … He’s a poor student and considered to be a bit of a wild child off the floor. Gaining some maturity and becoming more of a team player should be something that he focuses on … He’s very young so his long-limbed body is perfect for his age, however he must put on some muscle to play in NBA … In one-on-one defense, he doesn’t always exhibit enough intensity, but sometimes that is understandable in order for him to be as prolific as he is offensively …  ",6-8,215,SG/SF,Croatia,Intl.,2015

Highly fundamental, Kaminsky has great footwork, can go left and right and does a great job of using his length on offense … He can finish at the rim with either hand, post up on either block, shoot from the mid-range, consistently knock down 3’s and even attack you from off the dribble … The lack of quickness and explosiveness is compensated by his high basketball IQ … He is able to go by defenders on close outs, controlling his body to avoid charges, but also to basically post up from 16/15 feet and slowly back down defenders to the basket … His shooting touch is what is really intriguing about him … He didn’t shoot particularly well in the summer camps (adidas Nations) but he has been very consistent during this first part of the season, so far, even from long range, though he needs to get his feet set to be effective … He is a scoring threat from everywhere on the court … He loves utilizing his spin move, going back to the middle of the floor, and knows how to use it to be aggressive and shoot over his defender in a similar way of what Dirk does at the NBA level … Perhaps an area where he is a little underrated is passing, he has great vision of the court and makes really good decision with the ball, at his height he can see the floor really well and that can help in high-low situations, for example … A perfect guy to play pick and pop, very hard to ICE on ball screens, he spaces the floor well and he is also effective in the post … In the NBA, he will have to be a 4 offensively, and life will not be as easy to get by opponents, he will need to be a professor and learn all thr tricks with angles and fakes in order to not be neutralized by his lack of athleticism … Despite that he is 7-foot and able to contest shots in the paint, the long arms help him get many rebounds, but he will have to add strength to hold off NBA players while boxing them out …  20 years ago his size would probably have made him more appealing, in today quick, athletic game he will have to find the right system in order to show all of his skills offensively … He also possesses a high character with a lot of personality and confidence …  ",": The most obvious one is his subpar level of athleticism and lateral movement, but one of the main concerns with him ironically is on offense … It’s possible to find a role for him defensively where he won’t be exploited, he has length after all,  but will he be able to succeed in an offensive system different from the one he thrives in at Wisconsin? The fact that he struggled so mightily in the wide open format in front of so many scouts at adidas Nations in the summer has to be a conern … Theoretically he is the perfect guy to play in the triangle offense,  in a way that maybe only Pau Gasol did, and certainly he could find his place an offense like the Spurs (every high IQ player could) … But could he survive in more ISO oriented offenses where he will not have the ball in his hands much? A lot will depend on his consistency shooting, the percentages show us he is improving but the NBA 3 pointer is a different animal and though the high release will help Kaminsky a lot in shooting over people, his release is pretty slow and could be a problem … The talent is there but he has to show he can use it at the next level, and his limited upside (because he is already almost at the top of his game) and older age might scare some team away (Tyler Zeller was a much better/faster athlete and he fell to 20 as a senior, and has been traded)… Another big question mark is how will he deal with NBA physicality on both ends of the floor … He could potentially guard 5s but only if he adds strength to his body, while the 4 position could be too fast and explosive for him … And on offense people may push him out of the blocks too easily … The fact that he didn;t really do anything in his first two seasons in college is also a slight concern. Is he just a late bloomer, or is he taking advantage of players younger than himself as an upperclassman? … All that being said, we are talking about a player with a rare set of skills, who in the right system could utilize his abilities and become a great role player …  ",7-1,230,C,Wisconsin,Sr.,2015
Myles Turner,": The thing that jumps out the most is his exceptional length and frame … Measuring 6’11.5"" tall in shoes, and sporting a 7’4""; wingspan gives him elite size as an NBA power forward … While still a lean player, he wears his 243 pounds well, and has room to add weight and play at over 250 pounds without much or any projected loss in mobility or athleticism … Turner also has great hands, and a face up game giving him immense potential in the pick and roll and pick and pop heavy NBA landscape … Myles most certainly has an NBA position, and 13 games into his NCAA career, he’s really showcasing the type of shooter he is … Turner is shooting 40% from 3 point range, 44.4% on two point jumpers, and his model of efficiency translates down low as well where the young big is shooting 69.7% at the rim … It’s not often you see a guy pushing 7-feet among the conference leaders in free throw percentage, but Myles 89% clip ranks him 2nd in the Big 12, and 30th in the NCAA … Young for his class, Myles’ accomplishments and polish at just 18 years of age make him a very enticing prospect … He’s shown a great deal of creativity on the block … He’s already executing step backs jumpers, fadeaways, and shown a great feel for the offensive game very early into his collegiate career … With continued growth and polish he has the potential to be among the best shooting big men and stretch 4’s in the game … Defensively he’s no slouch either. In only 21 minutes per game, he’s leading the Big 12 in blocked shots (2.7 per game) and has emerged as a terror on the help side. He shows excellent timing and instincts to block shots, and gets off the ground quickly despite his lack of great fluidity … Also, with a reported 9’1.5"" standing reach, he has the length to contest shots 1 on 1 at the NCAA and NBA level, and while his current weight isn’t conducive to pushing around NBA big men, 240 pounds is considerably larger than many young forwards have come into the league at since the 1 and done rule was implemented … Turner even shows surprising passing and decision making with a 1:1 a/to ratio, unusual for a freshman big … Scores very highly in the character and communication department. Seems wise beyond his years and should have no trouble adapting to the NBA game and staying focused …  ",": Lacks fluidity, certainly he’s a guy who is mobile and can run the court, but his athleticism isn’t something that jumps out when you watch him … He has had some difficulties with his hips related to growth. His legs appear to be extremely stiff to the point where it appears he runs with a slight limp. Time will tell whether this is a temporary thing or he will always be a player lacking fluidity … Since he is so young, he could be one of those players who could improve his athletic ability, and flexibility with continued weight training … His lower body strength is probably of the most concern right now, as he can be pushed off the block and out of position by older, more physical NCAA players … While he’s definitely held his own in some bigger games this year, when matched against players his own size or larger from a bulk standpoint, he’s yet to really excel. In 5 games against major conference opponents, Myles has averaged 6.4 points, 6 rebounds, and 2 blocks per game which is big drop off when compared to 14.75 points, 7.1 rebounds, and 3.1 blocks per game against smaller mid major schools … There’s a lot to like about Turner, but his stats will need to be a little more reliable as he enters Big 12 play and doesn’t have the luxury of beating up on smaller schools who can’t match his size …  ",6-11,240,C,Texas,Fr.,2015

His junior season at Kentucky he shot 72.5% at the rim, and he’s an active player on the offensive glass which helped him rack up 40 put backs in 38 games … He had a number of highlight plays in which he went over and through defenders for highlight finishes at the rim … Although not a major offensive threat, he has improved his free throw shooting every season starting from an anemic .372% as a freshman, to a significantly better .617% as a junior (granted 61% remains below average) … This work has also shown up in his ability to knock down short jump shots in the half court game … He also has a decent jump hook which could potentially be honed over time … Cauley-Stein is also very productive in his time on the court … Due to UK’s depth he played just 25.8 minutes per game, but his per 40 minute averages are 14.1 ppg 10 rpg 2.6 bpg and 1.8 spg …  ",": Willie is very much a defensive oriented player, and a guy who really doesn’t project into much of an offensive contributor  … His work at the free throw line has shown some promise, but he projects mostly as a lob finisher, roll target, and garbage man in an NBA offense … His touch and shooting are a real weakness in terms of game speed … He’s also had some ups and downs over his career in terms of focus … For a player with such immense phyical gifts, it’s baffling that he wasn’t a more productive player early in his college career … Feel for the game is a major question mark … WCS has exhibited more poise, and fire as a junior, but he still has shown times in which he’s seemed a little passive or not 100% into the game … WCS has the feel of an athlete who is becoming a basketball player, and while the intrigue with his defensive abilities is apparent, he remains a project for the NBA level … Continued improvement and growth in terms of focus will be needed in order to play a long 82 game NBA season …   ",7-0,242,C,Kentucky,Jr.,2015

Montrezl Harrell,": Montrezl Harrell established himself as a true dunk machine during his tenure at Louisville, and an absolute monster around the rim … His 7’3” wingspan, strength and ferocious attitude allow him to wreak havoc on the glass at the NCAA level … His 3.2 offensive rebounds per game, and 9.2 total rebounds are both very good numbers for a power forward, and despite being around 6’7.5”, he has a reported 8’11” standing reach, which is adequate for his position in the NBA … His 43 put backs are a great example of how active he is around the rim … Harrell is also a quick leaper, and looks to have a frame that will allow him to add more muscle without slowing him down too much … He’s also a solid weak side shot blocker, and can hold his ground when being posted up, although he probably won’t be much of a one on one shot blocking threat once he hits the NBA … He has shown great improvement in his mid-range game since his freshman year … Although not a great shooter yet, he went from a 24.4% shooter on two point jumpers in 12-13, to a 36.8% shooter on two point jumpers in 13-14, and maintained that clip his junior year … His range is really in that 10 foot spot, but this development does show some signs of potential as a pick and pop player, while already possessing the qualities of a solid roll man … Harrell has also become a smarter player in his stint at Louisville … He now has pretty good vision in the high post, passes well out of double teams, and his feel for the game is much better than it was during his freshman campaign … Extremely vocal, loves to express himself on the floor and does so in a high energy fashion … ",": Montrezl is a power forward through and through, but his height leaves a little to be desired, and he has even explored the idea of becoming a SF while at Louisville … His wingspan and toughness does a lot to make this less of an issue, but his standing reach is still in a solid range for an NBA power forward … It’s safe to say, despite his physicality, many NBA big men will have no trouble shooting over him or posting him up in one on one situations … It’s unclear what kind of offensive game Harrell will have at the NBA level … His emerging jumper is a nice sign, but it’s still not really a selling point, at least, not yet … A poor free throw shooter, he hit just 59.7% of his shots at the charity stripe in 2014-15, and it was a career high … A likely garbage man on offense, despite the fact he hit a few 3 pointers as a junior, it’s not a shot you want him to take … He’s still better off doing what he can do around the rim, rather than trying to prove to NBA teams he can be a perimeter offensive threat as a rookie … Embracing his game, and what he does best will be key in his rookie season, and beyond.

Jerian Grant,": A familiar face for those who follow college basketball, Jerian Grant is a high level athlete for an NBA guard with explosive hops, strength, quick reflexes, and nice lateral speed … From an athletic, size standpoint alone, Grant screams NBA translation … At 6’5’’, and a mature 205 pounds, he possesses excellent size for an NBA point guard, and if you peg him into an off guard he still has good positional size … Jerian’s athletic ability and length allowed him to finish at a truly elite clip for an NCAA guard … He made 73.1% of his shots at the rim as a senior … Grant also has developed into a player who takes extremely good care of the ball, while setting up his teammates at a high level … His 6.7 assists per game as a senior (7th in the nation), were met with just 2.2 turnovers per game, which was good for a 3.04 assist/to ratio … Grant is also a strong shooter, both off the dribble, and spotting up … He hits FT’s at a good clip (78%) … His ball handling allows him to create space for himself, and he’s a very savvy 1 on 1 player, who has showed improved shot selection as he’s progressed as a player … From a defensive standpoint, he looks to be a player who can translate to the next level … He’s capable defending on the ball, and he’s also good in the passing lanes, which allowed him to finish 6th in the ACC in steals per game … He also is good challenging the shots of smaller guards, and even in the NBA his length will prove an asset when getting a hand up on NBA sized guards … Grant has also shown the ability to step up in big games … He looked amazing in Notre Dame’s run in the ACC tournament, and followed it up with a solid NCAA tournament  ",": While a polished and athletic guard, the first thing that comes up with a player like Jerian is how much left does he have to improve … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, and although I feel he’s not done developing, some may feel he lacks the ceiling of a younger player … Grant also got off to a hot start his junior year from beyond the arc before sitting out the second half of the season for academic reasons … Despite an early .408% clip, he regressed as a senior, and shot a pretty unimpressive .316% from downtown … Although Grant has good shooting ability, many of these shots were not quality shots, often coming off the dribble … He needs to adjust both his long range shot selection, and just gain more deep reps when looking towards the next level … He is also viewed as a combo guard of sorts, which isn’t a huge deal because of his positional size, if he is indeed a point guard, then he’s huge, but if he’s an off guard with some point skills, he doesn’t have that same advantage and intrigue … Improving upon the ability to set up others in the pick and roll will be important to his future …  ",6-4,200,PG,Notre Dame,Sr.,2015
Terry Rozier,": A high volume scorer with a nice handle and a knack for finding open teammates, Rozier transitioned from an elite high school scorer to an important cog in Louisville’s guard rotation as a freshman … Terry is a good 3 point shooter (.371 in 2013-14), and has the creativity and ball handling to create for himself off the dribble … Unlike many high octane combo guards, Rozier took great care of the basketball as a freshman turning the ball over only .6 times in 18.9 minutes per game which lead to an even 3/1 assist to turnover ratio … Known as a bit of a combo coming out of high school, this kind of care with the basketball, bodes well for more play at the point position, as his 6’2’’ frame leads a lot to be desired at the SG spot … Terry was extremely productive in his time on the floor last season, a great rebounder for his size, he stuffed the stat sheet in a supporting role putting up 14.8 ppg 6.6 rpg 3.8 apg and 2.1 steals per 40 minutes … An explosive athlete and very quick, Terry puts forth effort defensively and his 6‘6.5’’ wingspan is a good measurement for a player his size … Rozier also weighed in at 189 lbs at the 2014 Nike Skills Academy which is up nearly 20 lbs from his high school weight, this added muscle will most certainly help him.. . ",": Terry’s ability to score is one of his strengths, but like many young scorers, his shot selection is still a work in progress … His 40% FG percentage as a freshman was drug down by his scorer’s mentality … His prowess off the dribble often leads him to settle for 2 point jumpers more than he should … He only hit 32.2% on his 2 point jumpers during the 2013-14 season.. . Length can give him trouble when trying to shoot over taller opponents, and he shot an unimpressive 50.7% at the rim during his freshman campaign … Rozier was almost a no show in the 2014 NCAA tournament, floundering in college basketball’s biggest spotlight averaging only 1.3 ppg in 14 mpg over the Cardinals’ 3 tourney games … Continued development playing point is a must as his 6’2’’ 189 lb frame is very good for a point, but significantly undersized for a shooting guard …  ",6-2,190,PG,Louisville,So.,2015
Kevon Looney,": Talented forward with great physical attributes, who can be a very difficult match-up … Great instincts and aggressiveness as a rebounder, attacks the ball high and is dangerous on the offensive glass … High release on his shot, with potential to stretch his range … Shows potential to be efficient on the pick-and-roll, as well as the pick-and-pop … Unselfish player, has shown vision when in one-on-one situations … Length gives him potential as a defender, and he has been tough to shoot over when focused … Has to be accounted for as a shooting threat from the mid-range, plus has the ability to use the dribble on run outs … Becoming more confident as a cutter as his freshman season has progressed, getting used to being a threat playing without the ball … Relegated to thsolely playing PF due to his team’s lack of depth upfront, he has shown some ability as a wing. Although he’s a likely 4 for the NBA level … Gets to the line at a solid rate, aggressive even given his lanky frame at this point in time … Averaging over a block and a steal per game, his activity on defense is an encouraging sign regarding his future development … Effort and competitiveness have been solid during his freshman season …  ",": Will need to add upper body strength if he hopes to find the same success rebounding at the next level … A vast majority of his offense comes from offensive rebounds, so he will need to refine his skills and find other ways to score consistently … Has a slow, methodical release, and thus players can quickly close out on him leading to inconsistency shooting the ball … Not incredibly quick laterally, has a hard time guarding perimeter players once they commit to the dribble … Has been good around the rim, though still not as efficient as one might hope, which again points to lack of strength … For a player who moves as well as he does for his size, has not been overly efficient in transition … Rarely goes to his off-hand, needs a lot of work on his left … Foul trouble has been an issue, partly from playing out of position, though focus on defense has also been an issue … The “tweener” label may apply to him, needs to refine his skills and show more consistency as an overall perimeter player, while at the same time needing to gain strength while hopefully developing more of a traditional post game if he wants to excel as a PF ",6-9,222,PF,UCLA,Fr.,2015

Buddy Hield,": Very rarely do players improve dramatically between their junior, and senior years of college, but Oklahoma senior, Buddy Hield has taken his game to the next level during his 4th collegiate season … Always a strong outside shooter, Hield has improved his 3 point percentage to a lofty .523% on 7.9 attempts per game … He showcases NBA range, and even beyond, rendering him a player that needs to be guarded out to 26 feet away from the hoop … Through 19 games this season, he’s scorching the nets to the tune of 53% from the field, 53% from deep, and 90% from the stripe, and he reportedly shots between 500-700 jumpers a session outside of Oklahoma’s practices, which is an attribute to his work ethic and desire to improve … Early in his career, Buddy showed great promise off the dribble, and as a slasher, but during his sophomore and junior seasons, he became a bit predictable and took over half his shots from beyond the arc … He’s clearly addressed this, and both improved his handle, and his at the rim conversion rate this season … He made just 55% of his shots at the rim last season (according to hoop-math.com) and has risen that to 63.3% this season … He also gets to the free throw line 1.7 more times per game … Buddy’s handle is noticeably better, and this has been in aid in both creating for himself, and for others … He’s also shown the ability to dribble out of trouble, change speeds, and get past defenders … Buddy’s averaging a career high in assists (2.5) as well … Since Buddy is 22 years old, there has been no physical growth since my scouting report last year, but his 6’8.5’’ wingspan is still a nice metric for a player who stands 6’4.5’’ in shoes, and his conditioning is clearly at an elite level, which was noticed at in the knock-down, drag out triple overtime game vs Kansas, in which Hield hung 46 points, pulled down 8 rebounds, and dished out 7 assists … From a defensive standpoint, he is very solid considering the offensive load he carries for his team … He’s willing, has quick hands, and has amassed 27 steals and 10 blocks in 19 games … Looking towards the NBA, he may not project as an elite defender, but he’s more than physically capable … He’s quietly averaging a career high in rebounds (5.8) and has actually logged 8 or more rebounds 5 times this season.  ",": Buddy’s main knock will be his height for an NBA shooting guard, and although he’s improved his handle significantly in order to become more of a combo guard, he’s still not more of an undersized 2 … Buddy handles the ball a lot, and carries a great offensive burden for the Sooners, as a result he can be turnover prone at times (10 TO’s vs Oklahoma State) … Buddy has clearly worked to improve his game off the dribble, and now takes less than 50% of his shots from deep, in favor of driving to the hoop to keep defenders guessing … In reality, this is a player who has clearly worked very hard at not just what he does well, but his flaws, and as a result, he’s become a very complete player, that’s hard to nitpick outside of some physical differences between the size of NCAA players and those in the NBA … ",6-5,215,SG,Oklahoma,Sr.,2016

Not afraid of the big moments or the big stage … Plays with a calming presence at all times … Never seems rattled or off his game … NBA-level athlete that will pose a problem for opposing point guards in the league … A natural scorer (currently averaging better than 18 PPG) … Makes putting the ball in the basket look effortless … Moves well without the ball … Very good in catch and shoot situations … Possesses the ability to get hot from deep (shot 8/10 from three against Florida and 7/9 from three against Ohio State) … Shoots a lot, but has a true shooting percentage of 55.2% … Above average rebounder on the defensive glass for a combo guard (almost 6 RPG per 40 minutes) ",": Hasn’t played with the ball as much as anticipated, and not playing much PG in college games isn’t developing his skill at the position … The doubts about his ability to play full time PG could cosh him a few draft positions … In limited situations looks timid with the ball when not attempting to score … The tools and effort are there for Murray to be an above average defender, but will often lose focus off the ball … Will gamble for steals and hurt the team defensively … Might be the role Calipari is asking him to play, but looks like he would be a score first point guard at this stage of his development … Not much of a playmaker for others (averaging only 2.3 assists per game) … Can become too dependent on his outside shot in games (3/12 against  Tennessee, 1/10 against NJIT, 2/9 against Eastern Kentucky) … High volume shooter (averages 15 shots a game) … Too turnover prone, especially for an off guard, with 2.6 turnovers per game and a turnover rate of 13.6% … Doesn’t have outstanding length with only a 6’6.5″ wingspan … Can he blow by NBA level athletes consistently and keep defenders from crowding him … ",6-4,205,PG/SG,Kentucky,Fr.,2016

Does a good job of creating separation from defenders and then exploding past them in the post … Utilizes a developing righty hook, as well as a turnaround jumper when posting up … Needs to add some strength and toughness but actually has very good size and muscle for a player his age. Appears that he should be able to carry additional weight without any problem … 39.9% on 2 point jumpers is very solid, all things considered … Utilized his length well to register 1.6 blocks per game and shows some solid timing, when he is patient … Will turn 19 in July, so his age suggests he has a lot of potential left to develop …  ",": His low rebounding output is the first thing that scouts mention when dissecting his game. Considering his physical gifts, 5.4 rebounds per game should be higher, even at 25 minutes per game … He needs to work on becoming a better rebounder, both his fundamentals and effort level … He tends to just use his athleticism and doesn’t seem to have basic fundamentals in boxing his man out and holding position (something that works okay against college guys but won’t work against pros) … Feel for the game is still raw … Plays a little out of control on both ends of the floor … Low basketball IQ, especially defensively at this point and doesn’t anticipate well … Lacks focus and discipline defensively, too often bites on pump fakes, leading to foul trouble … Averaged 4.1 fouls per game, and fouled out of an astounding 15 games this year, including six in a row during Conference play. It’s no wonder why he played under 25 minutes per game, he was in foul trouble in virtually every game … Often tries too hard for the steal or block and doesn’t stay in a defensive stance … He’s then forced to chase down his man and over-extend, resulting in fouls on reaches or block attempts … Plays a little too upright, on both ends, but particularly on the defensive end … Too often finds himself out of position for help defense and on rebounds … Has good lateral speed but no one in their right mind would confuse him for a small forward … Maturity level was questioned as a freshman as he could be taken out of his game by bad calls or poor performance and it would show in his body language and interactions with refs … If he’s not dunking the ball, he struggles some in finishing on the move … Some may question his level of competition and the fact that he wasn’t more highly regarded out of high school … Should be able to improve upon his 68% FT shooting … Should also look to attack the basket and draw fouls more often than he did … Needs to cut down on his turnovers, 2.0 is a lot considering his minutes … ",6-10,235,PF,Washington,Fr.,2016

Juan Hernangomez,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Victor Claver/Jonas Jerebko Strenghts: This past summer he worked a lot on his upper body, becoming stronger and developing a solid frame … His improvement has been effective since it has been accomplished without losing any mobility and explosiveness … As a 6-9 PF, he has good size for the role, combined with excellent mobility and quickness … His game perfectly suits the evolution of modern basketball, with the need for big men able to switch in the P&R and hit shots from distance … Hernangomez is excellent in P&R, perfectly exploiting his ability to screen and slide with timing and quickness … He has shown intriguing range from 15-20 feet, opening the court in pick and pop situations and creating space in the middle of the area … He has shown the ability to attack the basket when served in movement after the cut, often drawing contacts and + 1 situations … What impresses the most about him is his stamina, he’s constantly moving, hustling for a rebound or a loose ball, finding ways to impact his team, even when not directly involved in the offense … He shots 75% from free throw line, solid and an improvable percentage.

His efficiency should improve in time thanks to a solid shooting form, but poor efficiency is definitely a cause for concern considering he’s a junior going on 22 in July … While he shows flashes of NBA athleticism, he’s far from a finished product … Defensive intensity and technique need work … While he gets a lot of steals and is active in passing lanes, he often falls asleep in ISO situations allowing his opponent to get by him. He then ends up gambling for the steal or block, which leads to fouls … Has solid potential as a defender, but it’s a big concern at the moment as it is more Swiss cheese than Cheddar … Needs to learn to play with the same energy and focus defensively as he puts into the offensive end … Despite being listed at 210 lbs, his frame does appear a little weak and that he could use added upper body strength … Decision making is a little wild at times as he will force shots and over penetrate … Does not lack for confidence, but at times, it can lead to poor shot selection … Must improve in the half court set in creating offense … Doesn’t have a clearcut NBA position as he lacks shooting for a 2 and size for a 3, but should figure things out with his above average speed and athleticism …  ",6-5,205,SG/SF,St. Joseph's,Jr.,2016

Cheick Diallo,": When comparted to other 6’9’’ players, Diallo has both terrific end to end speed, and a motor to keep him going. His stride is both effortless, and his constant effort re-affirms all the ravings about his motor dating back to his high school days. These traits make Diallo a transition threat as a big man, and also aid him as a chase down shot blocker in the open court. Cheick also has good length. Sporting a 7’4’’ wingspan and a 9’1’’ standing reach (according to the 2015 Hoop Summit) he sizes up pretty favorably for an NBA 4 man. While probably not an elite leaper, he gets off the ground very quickly, and is easily a good jumper for a 6’9’’ player. Transitioning his length and athletic ability to the NBA should not be an issue with continued physical maturity. He has great timing as a shot blocker, especially from the weak side. Despite limited minutes as a freshman, Diallo blocked 4.2 shots per game per 40 minutes, and actually would have done so without projecting to foul out (3.7 fouls per 40 minutes). He possesses a knack for rebounding the ball despite not always being in the best position. Cheick’s per 40 minute rebound numbers would come right in at 13.3 per game. His long arms, really aid in his ability to grab misses on the defensive end. He also showed the ability to finish strong around the hoop, and good hands catching alley oops. It should also be noted that despite a season in which he probably tallied a lot fewer minutes than he expected, Cheick was an engaged player off the bench, and showed positive body language and overall team support when his minutes began to fade during Big 12 play. ",": Cheick’s decision making offensively is really far away from being much of an asset at the NBA level. His usage percentage was 21.7% was 2nd only on the team to Perry Ellis’ 25.5% and Diallo only dished out 1 assist on the season to pair with 17 turnovers. Despite sporting a good overall FG% (54.7%) his shot selection showed he had little grasp of the flow of the game, and good ball movement. He was also prone to lazy passes due to lack of adjustment to the offensive speed of college basketball. He can hit a 15 footer at a decent clip, which is a positive sign for his shot development, but he’s got a bit of a hitch in his shot movement that would benefit him if he corrected. Diallo must also continue to hit the weights, he’s not ready for a major NBA role next season, but has a nice frame to add muscle. An extra 15 pounds and some physical maturity would do him wonders.

Taurean Prince,": At 6’7’’, possessing a strong 215 pound frame with long arms, and very good lateral quickness, Prince’s physical tools paired with excellent defensive instincts and intensity projects him as a player capable of guarding both shooting guards, and a large portion of small forwards at the NBA level … Playing in Baylor’s zone scheme, he still manages to block 1 shot and steal the ball 1.2 times in only 25.5 minutes per game (1.6 bpg and 1.9 spg per 40 minutes) … Unlike some players who rely on the zone to hide physical shortcomings, Prince’s defensive smarts and length allow him to excel in this scheme … This ability paired with a high defensive IQ projects him as a capable defender in the much different man to man heavy landscape of the NBA … Prince uses his athletic ability to finish strong at the rim (66.2%) and his speed to establish himself as a transition threat.

Markelle Fultz,": Fultz has elite physical tools for an NBA point guard at 6’5” with a 6’10” wingspan … He has big, strong hands, excellent feet, a solid frame, terrific body control, and he absorbs contact very well … He is very imaginite, shifty with the ball in his hands, can finish above the rim with regularity, and is an explosive leaper off of one foot or two feet when he has momentum … Fultz has great extension and finishing ability at the rim due to his length and large hands; his size and length allows him to get off his pull-up jumper and elevate over the top of other guards; also at times will utilize his size advantage in the post against smaller defenders where he can shoot over the top of them … He is a strong, physical player who does not shy away from contact, and he does a great job of going into the chest of the defender and maintaining control in the air so he can finish acrobatically … He uses his size to get to good scoring angles at the rim; his length also allows him to finish at the rim and make it difficult for defenders to contest his shot … Fultz has a very smooth all around offensive game with tremendous scoring instincts and the ability to put the ball in the basket from all three levels consistently … He has the makings of an elite go-to scorer, which is so valuable and rare at the next level … He can be effective playing both on and off the ball as a playmaker or scorer; an outstanding pick and roll player, excellent creativity and decisiveness as a ball handler … He does a great job of changing speeds and getting to his spots on the floor … In transition he pushes the ball up the court, gets downhill, and uses his elite body control to finish at the rim off the break … Fultz’s knowledge of how to use change of speed and directions is unusually advanced for someone his age, a skill that will translate to immediate success at the next level … Off the pick and roll, he does an excellent job reading his defender and has the ability to pull up all the way from three-point range if the guard goes under the screen or if the big man does not come up to help … He also has an excellent hesitation move that freezes the big man when he does come up to help; he has a deadly pull-up jumper off of the hesitation move, similar to the way Kevin Durant used this move so effectively at Texas … Fultz has an assortment of quick dribble moves from stepbacks, crossovers, spin moves, etc. if the guard gets through the screen … He’s also comfortable using his size, particularly when getting into his mid-range pull up; covers ground very well, uses long strides and consistently gets to the rim in one dribble when penetrating off the pick and roll … He has unique change of direction ability as well, which he uses in the paint to get by bigger defenders … He is a talented isolation scorer who uses hang dribbles and hesitations effectively; can make tough shots off the dribble; able to rise into jump shots off a one-two step and is comfortable making contested jumpers … His respectable pull-up game allows him to get to the rim much more easily when in isolation situations … He does a great job utilizing hesitation crosses to get in the lane and score; also does an exemplary job of being deceptive and unpredictable off the dribble … It is difficult to defend him because of his wide variety of dribble moves … He is not an elite catch and shoot player but more than capable of knocking spot up shots down from the perimeter … He has smooth mechanics with NBA range; also does a good job of knocking down shots when coming off screens where he has excellent balance and shot preparation … He’s very good at attacking closeouts as well, to pull up or finish at the rim … His great instincts are particularly shown in these situations; crafty finisher at the rim, has soft touch on two foot floaters with good balance; can stretch in the air around long defenders with his length; great finisher with his left hand where he gets excellent extension … Fultz is a creative, willing passer with an outstanding feel for the game; has a higher assist percentage and lower turnover percentage than Lonzo Ball … He will be a dangerous playmaker with NBA spacing and better shooters around him … He is dynamic in the open court and can make passes from numerous angels in transition … He does a great job of keeping his head up and finding big men running the floor or shooters on the wings in transition … He is also a terrific passer off the pick and roll, where he uses creative wrap around passes; will split the defenders off of ball screens and find big men in the short corners for easy conversions … Fultz is very patient off the pick and roll and does not force the issue often;will wait for the play to develop before making passes. He does a good job of using both sides of the floor and can make passes over the top due to size and length. Fultz must improve his focus and intensity, but he has the tools to develop into a lockdown defender at either guard spot; uses his body well to stay in front and has quickness to run stride for stride with smaller guards. His 6’10” wingspan makes him tough to shoot over; does a good job of being physical with bigger guards inside and can make things tough for big guys down low off of switches. He can cover a lot of ground, as shown by several chase down blocks this past season at Washington; also shows good instincts off the ball and has good timing on rotations from the weak side in the half court; a very low risk, high reward player; one of the most complete college guards in the last decade.  ",": Fultz is a very hard worker off the court who has shown dramatic improvement each year since his days in high school, but he can play with more consistent intensity in games … The game comes too easily for him, and he can take plays off particularly on the defensive end … He can be loose with the ball at times on offense … Especially turnover prone on his spin dribble … While fairly quick with his feet and creates extremely well with decption and hesitation, he’s not the fastest player running in the open floor … Fultz played on a bad Washington team but some question whether he can lead a team the way a star should at the next level given the low number of wins this past season … On defense he can be a little too upright at times, which causes him to struggle containing the dribble; his closeouts on perimeter can be lazy and out of control … He does not always fight through screens, allowing shooters to get open looks or quick guards to turn the corner; will lose focus of his man often when off the ball, frequently beat on backdoor cuts … Fultz is not overly turnover prone, but he can telegraph passes at times and be a bit lazy in this area, leading to avoidable turnovers … His shot selection is poor at times, but this may have been the result of having to carry the team at Washington … He will settle for a lot of tough mid range jump shots; has greatly improved shooting but still a bit streaky, more of a tough shot maker than pure shooter at this stage … He has a tendency to shoot on the way down on pull-up jumpers … He misses short a lot and needs to put more of an emphasis on getting legs into his shot … Fultz does not have the quickest first step and struggles to turn the corner against more athletic defenders … Will have to rely more on craftiness and deception to become an elite scorer in the NBA … ",6-4,190,PG,Washington,Fr.,2017
Lonzo Ball,": At 6’6"" with a 6’9"" wingspan, Ball has a unique set of physical tools for a point guard that will provide him with a number of advantages in the pros … One of the first things that stands out about Ball is his elite transition play … It starts with his ability to force turnovers and haul in defensive boards to push the ball up the floor and begin the break … He also has tremendous speed in the open floor when the ball is in his hands, but the skill that truly transcends above all other players his age is his elite vision, creativity and passing ability … Not only does he demonstrate the ability to deliver exceptionally accurate passes, but his knowledge of when to push the ball up the floor himself and when to give it up to his teammates is impeccable … He always knows where his teammates are on the floor and gets them the ball in spots they are comfortable … In a basketball sense he’s playing chess, while his peers are playing checkers … Ball constantly moves the ball, makes quick decisions, and has extremely rare vision for a player his age … He has excellent ball-handling ability, but does an exemplary job of not over dribbling and keeping everyone involved … He is also very efficient in transition where he posted an outstanding 4.1-to-1 assist to turnover ratio … The half court is where Ball is a more polarizing player, with transparent strengths and weaknesses to his game … His greatest strength in the half court is still his court vision and creativity prowess … At 6’6” he has the size to see over the defense and find shooters on the perimeter or make entry passes to the post … He also has the basketball IQ to see plays before they happen, which is not something you see often from a such a young point guard … More impressively, his willingness to move the ball was contagious, as UCLA’s offense featured constant fluidity and unselfishness from everyone on the floor … Ball might have the most unorthodox shooting mechanics you will ever see, but he is still a tremendous shooter, particularly off the catch and from long range … Ball connected on 41.2% of his 194 three-point attempts this past season, many of them from far beyond NBA range … Despite his odd shooting motion, he releases the ball squared to the basket and gets great rotation on his ball … In addition, Ball is an above average shooter on the move, as he does a good job getting his feet underneath him when coming off of a screen … He also has a lethal step-back jumper, which is one of his go-to scoring options in isolation situations or off the pick and roll … The combination of his deep range and comfort with the step-back can be a tough guard for opposing defenses … One, perhaps unexpected, area where Ball contributes offensively is cutting off the ball, resulting in easy conversions off of lob passes to the rim … In his one season at UCLA, he proved to be a much better athlete than most thought coming out of high school … Ball understands the use of deception and has a real knack for lulling his defender to sleep off the ball, then using hard backdoor cuts to create scoring opportunities … Ball will fit well in the modern up-tempo NBA game today …  ",": Ball has an outstanding combination of size, length, and athleticism, but his frame is not filled out yet, and he can struggle with more physical guards at times … This also hinders his ability to consistently get into the paint off the dribble … Wears a leg sleave and his legs appear to be underdeveloped … He has terrific speed but does not possess the quickest first step, which will make it more challenging to put pressure on the defense in the NBA … The biggest knock on Ball at this stage is his inability to consistently create his own offense when things break down … Ball is not great in isolation and generally his pick and roll possessions end up as a passer … He very infrequently used the pick to get into the paint and find his own offense … He also rarely showed signs of any mid-range game or the ability to pull up off the dribble … Ball will likely need to play alongside several other offensive threats to be able to generate his own offense in spurts … Where his awkward shooting mechanics can be exploited is off the dribble … On the one hand, Ball converted on 48.6% of his jumpers off the dribble, a number that was near the top in college basketball … However, rarely did he attempt such shots this season, and most of them were step-back three pointers rather than mid range pull ups … His inability to pull up in the mid-range is a function of his extremely slow shooting mechanics. Ball’s low release point and need to come back across his body certainly seem to factor into his inability to get his jumper off when pulling up off the dribble, and he has almost no in-between game because of it … He will need to develop a somewhat quicker release if he ever wants to be effective in this facet of the game … A lot of Ball’s baskets in the half-court at the rim were assisted, which indicates his ability to move off the ball along with his struggles creating his own shot off the dribble … On the defensive side of the court, Ball is adept at forcing turnovers, but he does not have the overall impact that his physical tools would suggest … Ball struggles at times containing dribble penetration against quicker guards, which was particularly exposed against De’Aaron Fox, who exploded for 39 points against him in the NCAA Tournament … Ball also does not have great awareness when being screened, and he also could show more consistent effort to fight through screens and recover … Ball is an intriguing prospect, but his weaknesses are well documented, and he will need to be surrounded by the right personnel to achieve optimal success … Perhaps the biggest question mark surrounding Ball has nothing to do with his game whatsoever … Some NBA execs view his father, LaVar as a potential problem with his ""over involvement"" and the endless controversial comments he has made over the last few months … The hope is that he will fade into the background and not be too involved with Lonzo’s day to day decision making, and ultimately career.

Jayson Tatum,": Tatum lived up to lofty expectations placed upon him in his freshman season at Duke, as a result of being heralded as a top-five high-school recruit by virtually every recruiting database … Despite the fact that he missed the first eight games of the season with a foot injury, Tatum developed into an absolute superstar by the end of the season for the Blue Devils, averaging 16.8 points, 7.3 boards, and 2.3 assists per game … Tatum’s NBA potential begins with his prototypical physical profile for a wing player … Standing at 6-8, with a 6-11 wingspan, he has an excellent frame that appears will fill out over time with broad shoulders and great hip mobility for his size … Tatum is a fluid athlete with long strides in the open court and the ability to cover a lot of ground … Another great tool Tatum offers is his ability to play small ball four man in short stretches like he did frequently at Duke. His uncommon skillset is visible right away in his ability to corral defensive rebounds and push the ball up the court effortlessly in transition … He is also great on the fast break off the ball, as he understands how to fill lanes correctly and get himself an easy finish at the rim … His impressively long strides also come to play in the half court, where he can catch from the arc and get all the way to the tin in one dribble … He has great extension when finishing at the rim, and his long wingspan allows him to finish above the rim in space … Tatum’s most intriguing selling point, however, is his highly advanced offensive skillset in the half court, and his NBA ready scoring ability … He is an exceptionally polished scorer for a 19 year old, having the ability to operate from all three levels. He is at his best in the mid-range area where he can create space and shoot over the top of the defense with a high release point on his jumper … He also has outstanding footwork and is never too sped up by the defense … Tatum excels out of the mid-post area as well where he has a variety of moves in his arsenal to beat his man … One of his weaknesses coming out of high school was his below average spot-up shooting from three-point territory … Tatum has improved in this area, as he is most certainly a capable threat from deep, especially off the drive and kick … He has also always been a terrific free-throw shooter (84.9% this season), which provides plenty of promise for further improvement down the road … He is also a good pick and pop threat when needed to play the four … He is particularly strong with his one dribble pull-up jumper going to his left, and he just does a great overall job of attacking hard closeouts with superb footwork … Tatum is probably the best isolation scorer in the draft as well … He utilizes a variety of hesitation pull-ups, jab steps, step backs, crossovers, spins, etc., and he can stop on a dime with ease to get into his shot … He was an absolute nightmare four opposing four men to guard, especially in the mid range, where he used his shiftiness and creativity to get into his mid-range game at will … He also is great at changing speeds in isolation situations to keep his defender off balance and get to the rim … Tatum is a handful to guard when facing up in the post … Defenders have to respect his ability to rise into his jump shot, but he counters this well with an explosive first step off the dribble going to his right … He also employs an occasional Dirk-like fall away jumper that is nearly impossible to guard, and he is great overall feel for where the defender is when posting up … He is still improving as a playmaker, but he has good vision in transition and can see over the top of the defense off the pick and roll … Tatum also has the tools to hold his own on the defensive end in the NBA as well in large part due to his size and length … He slides his feet very well when locked in and uses his length to his advantage (1.4 blocks and 1.6 steals per 40 minutes) … He can cover a lot of ground when closing out on shooters, as he would often run all the way from the ball side of the court and force a difficult shot when the ball was skipped over to his man … He also has the agility to contain quick perimeter players off the dribble and the length to consistently force contested shots … He shows flashes of great instincts and can cover a lot of ground rotating from the weak side to protect the rim … Tatum has good hands off the ball and anticipates passing lanes well … He proved to be a factor on the defensive glass, posting a clip 7.2 d-boards per 40 minutes … His professional approach to the game and work ethic are also noteworthy … He consistently demonstrated the ability to stay calm in pressure situations and come up big in crunch time … His game will fit well in the NBA, and he should be an immediate impact scorer … He is one of the more unique players in this draft and can be considered a low-risk, high-reward player …  ",": One of the first flaws that jump out in Tatum’s game is his inconsistent intensity on defense … At times, he seems to just go through the motions defensively and didn’t demonstrate the competitive desire to lock his man down … In addition, he is an excellent small-ball four on offense, but the same cannot be said about his defensive impact from this position … He is not physical enough to handle bigger players down low, and he needs to add some strength to his lower half … His technique on the perimeter can improve, as his closeouts can be quite lazy, allowing for his man to get by him with little resistance … He is also not the most physical perimeter defender and can do a better job of getting in his stance and containing the dribble … In transition, he does not always sprint back to the paint to help out against penetrating guards in the open court … In an NBA game nowadays that is heavily predicated on up-tempo offense with an abundance of quick guards who love to get in the lane on the break, this is something that he must address … One of the other question marks is that he is still a streaky spot-up shooter … He shot 34.3% from the arc at Duke this past season, which is not bad, but it is not good enough to classify him as an elite knockdown shooter … He is much better as a mid-range shooter and there are questions about if he will be able to adapt to the expanded three-point line in the NBA … Off the catch, his mechanics do not look quite as fluid when he is contested, and he is not always balanced on his release, which can also be a bit quicker … He also must become a more reliable scoring threat off the pick and roll … In these situations, defenders would mostly go under the ball screen, and he frequently would not make them pay with his pull up when this happened … Tatum also was guarded mostly by power forwards, so there are concerns about whether he will be able to create offense as effectively against NBA caliber wing players … His handle can be tightened, as he plays a bit too upright with the ball, making him less explosive … He does not have great burst from a stand still position, which causes him to struggle getting to the rim, and he has trouble finishing against top tier length and athleticism … This forces him to heavily rely on tough floaters and two-point jumpers, which is an inefficient way to score … Tatum can further refine his decision making on offense, as he can be too dependent on isolation offense, even if he excels in these situations … He is not the most comfortable playmaker on the move, and because of his inconsistent spot-up shooting in addition to that; there are questions about his effectiveness off the ball … These few factors will determine how high Tatum’s ceiling is …  ",6-8,205,SF,Duke,Fr.,2017
Josh Jackson,": One of the main things that jumps out at you is JJ’s versatility on both sides of the ball … From an offensive standpoint, he possesses a very high Basketball IQ that allows him to be aware of where his teammates are on the court … While he doesn’t play the role of a primary ball handler for Kansas, he’s averaging a very impressive 3.1 assists per game … He gets many of these due his natural knack of knowing where everyone is on the court, and having the touch and creativity to get the ball where it needs to go … His motor also jumps off the page, he’s an elite offensive rebounder for a 6’8’’ wing and is extremely assertive when he’s on the hunt for a loose ball, or rebound … Jackson also has a very solid first step, and the ball handling ability to get past defenders at a level that looks to translate to the NBA … He also plays within himself with the ball in his hands … He’s shown takeover ability this season for the Jayhawks, but for a freshman averaging 15.3 ppg, he’s very controlled, and doesn’t have the tendency to get sloppy for the sake of getting a shot … He’s an extremely disruptive and explosive defender too, with a solid 6’9.75’’ wingspan, which will aid him in his NBA translation … He’s not the type of defender that merely hinders his opponents ability to score, he’s deadly in the passing lanes, and is aggressive trying to steal the ball and deflecting passes … This results in a lot of fast breaks, and easy transition buckets … His shot blocking ability is also very impressive for a wing … Jackson blocks 1.5 shots per game (to go with 1.5 steals) and has the ability to get them in one on one situations, or coming over from the weak side … Jackson has also played 3 positions for Kansas this year ranging from the 2, to a small ball 4 … He looks to only be able to play shooting guard and small forward in the NBA, but he can do so effectively on both sides of the ball … Athletically he’s explosive, quick, and has good lateral, as well as open court speed … His assertiveness, and aggressive tendencies pair with his athletic gifts making him a regular on highlight reels, and this is a valuable quality in regards to team momentum … Has a blue collar work ethic and willingness to do the dirty work, does not exhibit the prima donna attitude often associated with elite level prospects … An extremely competitive and passionate kid who brings a high level of intensity and desire to improve …  ",": Jackson’s biggest weakness right now is his shooting … While his athleticism, and his ability to play within himself leaves him with a .52% FG clip, he’s shooting just 28% from deep, and 54% from the charity stripe … His shot is not broken or beyond fixing, and he does have touch, but it does have a little hitch that will take time to correct … His aggressiveness is more often than not a good thing, but this can render him in foul trouble, which can frustrate him … He’s picked up 3 technical fouls, all due to frustration of foul calls, through Jan 7th of 2017 … He’s picked up 4 or more fouls in 5 out of Kansas’ first 15 games, and fouled out of three, so cutting down on fouls early in games will be key … Jackson is a pretty good rhythm jump shooter, and has real potential shooting off the dribble, so the honing of his shot is key to him taking the step beyond a high level two way role player and an All-Star level player …  ",6-8,205,SG/SF,Kansas,Fr.,2017
De'Aaron Fox,": De’Aaron Fox is a kid that plays with a great attitude and enthusiasm … He has an excellent combination of size, length, and athleticism … At 6’3” with a 6’6.5” wingspan he has a great set of physical tools for a lead guard … His 8’4 standing reach is solid size for a 2-guard … Where Fox particularly stands out, however, is his elite end to end speed in transition that drew numerous John Wall comparisons during his freshman season … He also has an outstanding first step from both a stand still position and off the dribble and is an explosive leaper with the ability to finish above the rim regularly … He is an absolute blur with the ball in the open court and has great shiftiness that allows him to get to the rim at will … Fox also has a tight handle and does a terrific job of changing gears; his ability to play slow to fast is partly what makes him so difficult to stay in front of … When he has a driving lane to the basket he shows tremendous burst and change of pace before turning in frequent emphatic finishes at the rim … In the half court, Fox’s speed is just as useful … He is gifted with tremendous burst that makes his ball handling ability even more effective, allowing him to get into the paint off the dribble, even without a ball screen. He projects to be among the NBA’s most elusive guards from day one … His elite burst and ball handling allow him to create via the pick and roll or isolation (21.2 points per 40 minutes), and he does a good job of drawing contact and getting to the free throw line (7.5 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Fox still needs to add more consistency with his shot, but he is a capable mid range shooter off the dribble with sound mechanics … His jumper in the long run is encouraging as he gets great elevation and releases the ball high … When he cannot get all the way to the rim, he utilizes an impressive floater with good touch … He combines his quickness with the ability to drive with either hand, and he does a great job of changing gears with the ball in his hands … He uses a variety of dribble moves and counter moves to freeze his defender from hang dribbles, hesitations, hard crosses, in and outs, etc … Fox also demonstrates great footwork on his crossover into his pull up jump shot, where he is capable of knocking it down if the defense sags off too far … Off the pick and roll, he is an absolute mismatch for big men that occasionally get caught switching on him; he will use hard in and out dribbles that cover a lot of ground to blow by defenders and get to the basket … He can also cover a lot of ground with the dribble and rarely is there any wasted movement with the ball … Despite being taller for a lead guard, he has a low dribble that makes him much more explosive and difficult to contain … He is constantly keeping the defense guessing by playing high to low and slow to fast, which really aids him when his jumper is not working for him … Fox is not an elite facilitator yet, but he has solid vision (5.8 assists per 40 minutes) … His ability to collapse the defense on the drive points towards high upside as a playmaker … He also has the size to see over the top of the defense with an improving pick and roll game as well … Fox has good vision in space and always keeps his head up in transition, showing the ability to deliver accurate passes with either hand to teammates running the floor … Fox has outstanding potential as a defender as well with his size, length, lateral quickness, and instincts … He also has elite reaction time with quick hands and high activity off the ball … At times he will pressure full court and make it very difficult for opposing ball handlers to initiate an offense … He shows great motor in this end of the court as well, as he does en exemplary job of helping off the ball, and still closing out to his man under control when the ball is kicked out. He does an outstanding job of stopping his man’s first move and forcing him to change directions … He anticipates passing lanes very well and has active hands on the ball to force turnovers … ",": The biggest obstacle for Fox in his transition to the NBA is his lack of a consistent jump shot … Fox made just 31% of his pull-up jumpers, and 20% of his spot up attempts in the half court this season, but he connected on a far more respectable 55% and 36% of those attempts respectively in March … When his jumper is not working, his half-court scoring becomes much more limited and the defense can sag off of him, which somewhat negates his elite quickness … One piece of his shot that he could fix is his tendency to flex his elbow too more, creating almost a slingshot-like release … Fox does not have NBA range at this stage and is much more effective inside the arc; he needs to work on being balanced more consistently on his pull-ups … Fox still is learning to find the right balance between scoring and facilitating … He has a tendency to get too sped up when going to the rim and be a little out of control … He does not always anticipate a play well before they happen, and he can work on his timing with passes … He could also work on his timing and patience off the pick and roll, as he can be especially turnover prone in this department … Fox is still young but he will need to add strength and fill out his wiry frame to hold up over time against the bigger guards in the league … He may struggle initially with bigger guards on defense and finishing through contact in the NBA … He has potential to be a lockdown defender, but sometimes he can be a bit too upright on the ball, which mitigates his lateral quickness … ",6-3,170,PG,Kentucky,Fr.,2017
Dennis Smith,": Smith is arguably the most explosive athlete in the draft, despite tearing his ACL a little over a year ago … He is very shifty with the ball in his hands and has tremendous burst … An elite level athlete who attacks the rim like a player 5 inches bigger … Possesses solid size for a PG at 6’2 in shoes with a 6’5 wingspan and 8’1 standing reach … He is also a strong, physical guard with the ability to absorb contact and finish acrobatically at the rim (61% at the rim) … Smith has outstanding leaping ability off of both one or two feet, which led to numerous highlight reel dunks in his freshman year at NC State … He also has the strength, quickness, and speed to be an excellent on ball defender when locked in … Smith is a nightmare to guard in the open court with and his ability to change gears with power … He also attacks the rim fearlessly off the bounce where he can finish explosively above the rim with regularity … He also has an excellent first step from a stand still position and can cover a lot of ground with the dribble … He does a great job of inviting contact and getting to the free throw line frequently (6.9 free throw attempts per 40 minutes) … Smith’s strength also helps him fight through screens and recover quickly defensively … He has quick hands and good instincts and can really be a problem for opposing ball handlers when pressured (2.2 steals per 40 minutes) … Smith is a score first point guard with the ability to put pressure on the defense via isolation or the pick and roll … He is quite difficult to stay in front of due to his shiftiness and ability to drive with either hand … He is also improving as a shooter, particularly from long range where he shot a respectable 35.9% this season … Where Smith truly shines on the offensive end, however, is his ability to create his own offense … He can fill it up from all three levels, which will bode well for him in a modern NBA with an abundance of scoring point guards … He does a good job of reading his defender off the pick and roll and has the ability to rise into a pull up jumper, where he gets great elevation … He also frequently utilizes a lethal step back jumper when the guard is able to recover off the screen … He improved as a 3 point shooter as his freshman season progressed … Smith is a tough shot maker with the ability to bail his team out late in the shot clock … He has the ability to make a play on the offensive end every time he touches the ball in one way or another … Especially when his jumper is falling, there is almost no way to guard him because his so dangerous off the dribble and getting to the basket … He is exceptional at creating space with jab steps, a variety of dribble moves, and a quick rising pull up jumper … He is best when on the ball but is a capable spot up shooter when left open … He has an innate ability to attack closeouts hard to pull up off the dribble or finish at the rim … Smith primarily is looking to score, but he is a capable playmaker as well (6.8 assists per 40 minutes) … He wasn’t in an ideal situation at N.C. State, but he is capable of creating space, surveying the floor and passing the ball with either hand out of pick and roll situations … With better talent around him in the NBA, he will look like an even better playmaker … His open court speed makes him particularly dangerous in transition, as he will collapse the defense and find cutters or open shooters on the perimeter … He does not need a screen to collapse the defense … Instead he can usually break his man down off the dribble and get in the paint to kick out to open teammates … He also shows flashes of impressive vision and accuracy off the pick and roll … He will have a chance to be an absolute force on both ends of the court in the NBA … Has excellent size at the point guard position at 6’2 with a 6’5 wingspan … Shows a lot of confidence in his abilities and has a swagger on the floor, should not have any trouble adjusting to playing at the NBA level and be a standout PG at the next level … His upside is among the best of any player in this draft … ",": Questions about attitude, focus and desire have surrounded Smith since his high school days … Has a tendency to rely on his physical gifts and not pay enough attention to detail in regards to improving as a PG … As talented as Smith is, he is still learning how to play the position and run a team offense at an optimum level … He can improve his feel for when to create his own offense or when to facilitate … He did not always seem to be on the same page with his teammates, which could be interpreted as a lack of leadership … His overall decision-making, particularly off the pick and roll still need to improve, and he needs to become more vocal to be a quality leader in the NBA … He can be a bit turnover prone, as he has a tendency to make careless entry passes and pick up his dribble against pressure without knowing where he wants to go with the ball … He does not always initiate the offense with consistency and can learn to be more unselfish … Often times he will launch a contested shot without any prior passes or turn it over before any set is run … Smith also will settle for long jumpers early in the shot clock or force contested pull up jumpers instead of getting all the way to the rim or making a play for someone else … In transition he is dangerous, but he does not always look ahead for open teammates and will instead force a low percentage shot … He does the same off the pick and roll where he will frequently miss wide open teammates when double teamed off the screen … Smith struggled with consistency this past season in terms of effort and overall impact … Fell asleep defensively far too often showing a lack of commitment and focus … Despite the fact that he has great upside defensively, his intensity has to improve … Smith did not have a great situation at NC State, but a player as talented as him should be able to carry them to a more successful season … Too often he proved to be lazy fighting through screens and closing out on shooters … He can be too upright and often appears uninterested in keeping his man in front of him … As a shooter, he still has room to improve, as he is best with some upward momentum … He releases the ball on the way down sometimes and has an occasional hitch at the top of his release, which leads to sporadic results …   ",6-2,195,PG,NC State,Fr.,2017
Jonathan Isaac,": A ""tantalizing"" prospect, Isaac has a rare combination of size, length, and fluidity for wing player, in many ways similar to Kevin Durant at the same age from a physical and skill standpoint; at 6’10.5” with a 9’0.5” standing reach … He has the size to play the four (and possibly even 5) when necessary and be a presence inside once his frame fills out, but he also runs the floor like a natural wing player … Isaac has long strides, is light on his feet, and can get up and down the floor in a hurry … He has uncommon quickness for a player his size, which he utilizes very well when cutting off the ball to lose his man and create easy looks … Isaac is a quick jumper and shows good vertical explosion, particularly off of two feet when he has momentum to the basket … His length and athleticism also point towards potential as a rebounder … He showed flashes on the glass regularly at Florida State, averaging 9.6 rebounds per 40 minutes, and should develop into an even more potent rebounder as he matures … On the perimeter, he can be a mismatch, as his size and length give him the ability to get his shot off over just about any wing defender … Isaac’s jumper looks promising and should become even more dangerous with time and repetition … He is not going to be a 40-plus percent shooter from three-point land right away, but he has clearly established himself as a threat from outside (1.7 made threes per 40 minutes) with the ability to make tough pull-ups and fadeaways … Isaac is also a sound ball-handler and despite not having carte blanche at Florida State, he has shown the ability to create his own shot with a variety of moves … His ability to pull up off the dribble is extremely intiguing … He utilizes hesitations, crossovers and step backs with crisp footwork to blow by or separate into a jump shot … These flashes of shot creation at his size fuel his scoring potential and drive his potential through the roof … He does not have the most advanced feel for the game yet, but he also shows flashes as a facilitator … As a shooter he is a bit streaky but shows good shot preparation and balance with a high release … He has excellent slashing ability as well and does a great job attacking closeouts with long strides … Isaac also has a quick first step and a strong rip through move that gives him good momentum when driving to the basket … However, he is more than just a straight-line driver; he does a great job of changing speeds and directions with a variety of dribble moves, and he has excellent hip mobility … He can also shoot over the top of smaller defenders while posting up with his size and length … His size also helps him as a passer, as he can see over the top of most defenders; and has good vision … The potential for Isaac as a defensive stopper is also very intriguing … He has the tools to eventually become a player that can lock down multiple positions … He moves laterally quite well and should become a valuable switchman off the pick and roll … He has the agility and foot speed to contain smaller players on the perimeter but also has the size and reach to give bigger players a hard time down low … He is not ready to play down low regularly, but he is long and agile enough to provide glimpses of rim protection when needed to play the 4 …  He is a late bloomer that was a 6’3” guard in high school and is just scratching the surface of his abilities … Players with his combination of size, length, fluidity, and skill are extremely rare, and he will be a great fit in today’s NBA … If he can put it all together, he will be a star … Isaac’s overall upside is off the charts and may be higher than any player in this draft, and in the right situation he may ultimately end up the best player …  ",": Isaac still has not grown into his own body yet, and is very thin for his size at only 205 pounds … He has a lot of skill but has to rely on finesse a bit too often rather than physicality … He struggles on the interior as a 4 man due to a lack of strength and toughness, and he can be pushed out of his spots pretty easily on offense … For example, he lacks the core strength to get all the way to the rim against physical defenders and can get knocked off course, especially when he elevates … Isaac has a tendency to shy away from contact and often will not explode all the way to the rim even when he has his man beat … On the interior he struggles to hold his position when posting up and will settle for fall away jumpers rather than getting to the basket … Though he has potential on defense, he allows himself to be screened easily and lacks the physicality to fight through screens … He also lacks the strength to guard the post with consistency, which limits his ability to play the four regularly … His lack of strength also affects him on the glass, where he can get bullied often and pushed out of position … He also does not always box out and relies too much on his length to track down misses … He still needs to become a more consistent shooter to become a truly reliable threat from the outside, and he is not a great ball handler under pressure … He has a tendency to settle for tough jumpers even when he has an open lane … He does not always read and react to the defense well and can waste dribbles without covering any ground … He may be best suited as a mismatch four man at the next level rather than a pure wing player, as he has a solid handle but does not always get somewhere with the dribble … He needs to become stronger with the ball as well … Isaac has good vision with the potential to become a solid playmaker, but right now his timing and accuracy are not great, and he can put his teammates in bad spots at times … He can also improve his discipline on the defensive end … He will bite on too many fakes on the perimeter and takes poor angles on the ball … He gets lost off the ball too often and needs to do a better job of seeing his man and the ball simultaneously … Isaac has loads of talent, but he has a bad habit of disappearing for stretches, especially after a bad play or two … He can improve his ability to move on to the next play … He will need to learn to stay locked in and focused for the entire game to become more consistent and reach his full potential … While his ceiling is substantial, his readiness is not where some of his peers in this draft are at, giving him a bigger basement as well, and greater risk … ",6-10,210,SF/PF,Florida St.,Fr.,2017
Frank Ntilikina,": Elite size for a point guard with very good athleticism and quickness … Impressive wingspan (close to 7 ft)… Very mature for his age with a good basketball IQ … He has a thin frame, but his body structure suggests that he can add weight and increase his muscle tone nicely … A true point guard with a “pass first” mentality … He can control the pace of the game nicely … Excellent passer with great court vision … He is always looking to find the open teammate … He can pass on the move and also while penetrating … Excels on the open court and loves to run the break … Great ball handler … He has a nice hesitation dribble and he has also an improving crossover dribble on his repertoire … Possesses an explosive first step … Really good on ISO situations thanks to his athleticism, length and excellent ball handling … He can create his own shoot and score off the dribble from mid-range and has also a floater as a counter move … When he has time to gather he can finish strong at the rim… Improving 3-point shooter… He is already very good on Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, because he shows patience and is always looking for the right choice … His body and physical tools are his biggest weapons on Defense … He has great lateral quickness which helps him stay in front of his man … When he is motivated on Defense he can be a lockdown defender … His length and athleticism help him make a lot of steals … Versatile defender with the potential to guard multiple positions in the future … He has a high upside…  ",": He really needs to add some muscle to his body or else he could have problems at the next level … He hasn’t been tested at a senior level yet … His shooting release looks a little odd at times and that’s the main reason he isn’t a consistent shooter from long range yet … He needs to become more vocal and learn when he has to take over a game … At times he is too unselfish and too keen to pass the ball and as a result he looks passive … He must add some aggressiveness to his game … He has problems finishing through contact at the rim due to his thin body and at times he looks like he is even avoiding contact, settling for a mid-range shot … He has problems against physical game … He isn’t always focused on defense … At times he forgets to keep a low stance when he is guarding his opponent and as a result he can be crossed easily … He relies too much on his length to make steals when he gets crossed, which leads to bad fouls … He has problems defending the Pick and Roll, looking lost at times … Stronger players can post him up ",6-5,190,PG,France,Intl.,2017
Malik Monk,": Explosive guard who is one of the more adept scorers in his class … Has great touch on his shot and has been deadly from long-range off the bounce and catch … Great elevation while shooting, has ability to shoot off of screens while also being able to freeze the defense off a hesitation dribble … Jumps really well off of both feet, though also a strong single foot jumper as well … Dangerous in transition and the open floor, can score above the rim and is tough to stop if given space … Has shot an highly efficient mark from short, mid and long-range jump shooting, currently making 3.1 3PT shots per game at 40% (61-153) … Adept at the two, three dribble pull-up, has tools to create some of his own offense … Has solid lateral quickness and good feet, gets most of his steals playing the passing lanes and can cover ground … Even as a high volume scorer, plays within himself and has been a willing passer … Plays bigger than his size, despite being undersized his athleticism does some things to make up for it … Likely close to 200 lbs, is strong and has a chance to build body over time … Really nice arc on his shot, most of his misses are pretty close and lead to better possibility of offensive rebound opportunities … Conditioning is very good, shows solid energy throughout games … Near 50% FG, 40% 3PT and shooting 83% FT, strong shooting indicators along with the speed and athleticism that lead to his immediate boost on the offensive end … On a very talented team, has efficiently and comfortably taken on a major scoring role, talent seems to shine through even among the best … Has to be taken into account past three-point line, will stretch the floor and should be incredibly confident shooting from NBA 3PT range … While he has done his best job defensively off the ball, has tools to be a much better on-ball defender … Gets low in stance and when he is focused he shows some defensive intensity … He does play with two point guards, which could lead to questions of whether he could improve his assist rate if given a bit more of time on the ball offensively … Looks to be a hard worker, strong communicator and solid teammate ",": Certainly best as a scoring guard, though at around 6’3 with a 6’6 wingspan, definitely would be considered undersized and could struggle defending bigger guards … While some have referred to him as a combo guard, he is not particularly comfortable setting up the offense and does not really show the vision of a primary handler … Can be a bit loose with his handle and decision making, not entirely comfortable beyond a few dribbles creating for himself … Low FT rate, while he scores from all three levels does not get to the basket often enough and can be thrown off by contact … Has struggled defending at the point of attack and on-ball, one might not be sure how versatile he is as a defender … Low steal and block rates, as well as surprisingly low rebound rate given his explosive athleticism …  Has not shown much ability in the pick-and-roll, once again leading to questions about his translating to a lead guard … Seems to be heavily reliant on his shooting at this point, which leads to questions about what he brings to the table if his shot is not falling … Has not been asked to do much off of the cut, which one might think he would be more involved in given his athletic gifts … Very little of his scoring has happened close to the basket off of the dribble, has needed someone to create those opportunities for him … As great as he has proven to be as a shooter in his freshman year, he was just an average shooter throughout his high school career, adding some skepticism about his incredible shooting accuracy at Kentucky … ",6-3,200,SG,Kentucky,Fr.,2017
Lauri Markkanen,": Markkanen was one of the top freshmen in college basketball last season, despite a middle of the year shooting slump, scoring 15.6 points per game on 42% shooting from beyond the arc … Markkanen’s combination of size and skill makes him one of the more intriguing prospects in the draft, and he will have the chance to develop into a valued stretch-four man in the Association … He is mature young man and appeared to be an exceptionally focused and likable teammate in his one year at Arizona … Markkanen’s upside starts with his outstanding size for an NBA power forward at 7-0 and 230 pounds … He is a fluid athlete with great coordination for his size … Most of the intrigue with him, however, is his unique offensive skillset … Markkanen is a high-IQ player that knows how to play the game very efficiently … As mentioned above, Markkanen shot 42% from distance on 5.9 attempts per 40 minutes, and he may actually be the best shooter in this draft regardless of position … He has smooth mechanics, a soft touch, and good balance off the catch … He is not only lethal off the catch, but he is also a prolific shooter on the move off of screens, pull-ups, face-up jumpers out of the post, etc … He particularly showed these abilities off earlier in the year when teammate Allonzo Trier was out for the earlier part of the season, causing him to play a lot of small forward and rely on more perimeter scoring … With more spacing at the NBA level, he will be a tremendous pick and pop threat and be able to maximize his shooting ability … Markkanen moves well without the ball when looking to spot up from the perimeter, and he knows how to find the open spot on the arc to get off a good look … His mechanics also stay consistent even when his shot is contested … He always gets his feet under him and does not waste any motion from catch to release … He runs off of screens like a guard, as he gets his feet set quickly and appears to be very comfortable rising into his shot here … In addition, he has great footwork when chased off the three-point line and can effortlessly shoot the ball off the dribble, especially going to his left … He even showed flashes of pull-up jumpers as a pick and roll ball handler in his arsenal, something extremely rare for his size … His agility for his 7-0, 238 pound frame jumps out, as he is decently effective off the bounce, which will be key for him going forward when defenders chase him off the arc … He has a pretty quick first step that is definitely good enough to get by many of the players that will be guarding him in the NBA … He is very good going to his left with the ability to put it on the floor and finish going left just as comfortably as he does with his right … Markkanen is not a high level athlete, but he can finish above the rim in space due to his superior height and decent leaping ability for his size … He also does a solid job of attacking the offensive glass for a stretch-four man … He does a great job of stepping out and hedging ball screens as well, a situation he will probably be in quite often in today’s pick and roll heavy NBA. Markkanen’s role in the NBA will be clearly defined as a stretch-four man, who can thrive in the role of instant offense off the bench or something along the lines of what Ryan Anderson brings to Houston … ",": As skilled as Markkanen is on the offensive end, he offers nowhere near the same potential on defense … His lack of strength is a major soncern as he gets toseed around pretty easily by NCAA bigs and already has filled out with broad shoulders … His core and leg strength need a lot of work, and may never allow him to battle inside against the NBA’s top post players … He does not have great length, limiting his ability to protect the rim, and being thin for his height, he plays a lot smaller than his size … He may be more of a mismatch as a stretch-five man on offense, but the flip side is that he may not have any chance to slow down most centers on the defensive end … As mentioned, Markkanen’s lack of a strong base hinders his ability to battle for position in the post … He is also not very physical down low, and he does not have the length to contest shots from other post players to make up for his inability to fight for good position … Combine his lack of length with just average timing and instincts, and he could be a potential liability on this end of the court … On the perimeter he has good feet, but he has a tendency to bend his back instead of his knees to get down in his stance, which eliminates some lateral quickness and effectiveness … He is a nightmare to guard as a stretch-four on offense, but he often gets lost when trying to defend opposing stretch-fours on the perimeter … His intincts in defending the pick and roll and knowing when to come help from the weak side also needs to improve … His rebounding ability is also less than stellar for many of the same reasons that his defensive upside is limited … Markkanen averaged an underwhelming 9.3 rebounds per 40 minutes, as he lacks the length, range, and toughness to be a force in this department … He does not always work hard to get great position when the shot goes up, nor does he have the necessary frame to push opposing big men out of position … Scouts also question how much more there really is to his offensive game than just his shooting ability … He does not appear to have much of a post game, other than simple jump hooks and turnaround jumpers and is not a great finisher in traffic … Not the most vocal or demonstrative person, will need to work on being more assertive and vocal on the floor … He also is not a very gifted playmaker at this stage (1.2 assists per 40 minutes) and he goes left most times he puts the ball on the floor … He is much better attacking off the dribble from the catch than in isolation situations, and he does not look nearly as natural shooting the ball when going to his right hand … Aside from the defensive concerns, he also must develop his offensive repertoire outside of his jump shot.

Zach Collins,": Young center with excellent size and coordination … Runs the floor well possessing very good mobility … Has a great frame, showing the ability to carry a lot of weight and remain fast and athletic … Strength shouldn’t be much of an issue for him at the next level after a season or two … A stellar defender with good lateral quickness, especially for his size … Has a versatile offensive game with solid post skills as well as the ability to face up and hit midrange and outside shots … a fiery competitor, he gets agitated when he’s beaten or challenged, and generally channels it in a positive way … Possesses a very nice shooting stroke with the form to extend his range to the NBA 3 point line … Showed the ability to knock down the college three, having hit 10/21 on the season (47.6%) … Solid rim protector and shot blocker averaging 1.7 boards per game in limited minutes … Plays on balance, and doesn’t rush things … Not afraid to mix it up and seems to enjoy contact … Does a good job of forcing contact and getting to the free throw line … Has good hands, with good control of the ball on post entries and rebounds … A very effective socrer, with a 67.8% eFG% according to Hoop-Math.com … Gutsy player. Showed the ability to be a clutch shooter hitting a huge three in the closing minutes against South Carolina in the Final Four … ",": Remains somewhat unproven having played sparse (17.3 mpg) minutes as a back up to Przemek Karnowski in his freshman season at Gonzaga … Hit 74% from the FT line and while solid, with his form and touch he should be in the 80s … Can improve upon his overall feel for the game and decision making … Lacks great vision and passing ability, had just 16 assists on the season, and can be forced into mistakes with double teams … The majority of his season was against the WCC, meaning that he didn’t play a ton of NBA caliber bigs … Being a freshman that played limited minutes in a smaller conference will mean he has a sharper adjustment curve upon entering the league … May need to be careful with fouls at the next level as he fouled out of the Xavier game in the tournament in just 13 minutes … ",6-11,230,C,Gonzaga,Fr.,2017
Luke Kennard,": Crafty lefty with an ability to score from anywhere on the floor … Big time development from his freshman to sophomore campaign …  Extremely fluid player on the offensive end … One of the best shooters in college basketball and can do so in both catch and shoot situations as well as coming off screens … Good pull up game as well … Not an overly quick first step but defenses must respect his ability to knock down shots with limited space so it helps him get defenders off balance … Moves extremely well off the ball and creates a lot of space with his ability to utilize screens … Extremely high basketball IQ with improving play making abilities.  Good vision in both the half court and open court settings.  Limits turnovers for a guy with the ball in his hand as much as he did last season with Duke not having a true PG … Can finish at the rim and through some contact and has the ability to use both his left and right hands to get shots off once in the paint … Good size (6’6) for the two-guard position at the next level but lacks great length … 6’5 wingspan and 8’4 standing reach, the same as Donovan Mitchell … Showed great leadership capabilities during his sophomore season at Duke as he was the glue that held the oft injured/suspended team together during the season’s first two months … ",": Not a bad athlete by any means but not the explosive type of guy that you would want out of a potential lottery pick … He’s going to play on the wing at the next level and will be going up against the league’s best when it comes to that category … His aforementioned wingspan would rank in the bottom third of the league at 6’5 … Lacks explosiveness at the rim and is more of a crafty scorer than a guy that is going to get into the lane, absorb a ton of contact and get to the free throw line … Moves his feet well on defense but can get burned by quicker players on the perimeter … Will need to be in a good defensive scheme with better individual defenders around him to be effective on that end of the floor … Had an extremely poor showing in the NCAA Tournament as Duke fell short of expectations as they fell to South Carolina in the Round of 32 … ",6-6,195,SG,Duke,So.,2017
John Collins,": 6’10” interior presence that is very active for a big man … Has the length and skill to be highly effective around the basket … Plays with good energy, effort and consistency … Doesn’t shy away from opponents, can play through contact at the rim … Rebounds at a very high level … Attacks the ball when it is in the air … Very quick second jumper. Explosive leaper … Keeps plays alive with effort on the offensive glass … Positions himself well, always around the ball when it comes off the rim … Uses body to get to the places he wants on the floor … Good enough footwork to do some damage in the post, especially against smaller players … Scores easily down low (62.1 FG% on the year to date) … Great in transition, constantly beating opposing players up and down the floor … Has a smooth stroke and has the ability to knock down jumpers in the mid-range … Not much of a perimeter threat, but can put the ball on the floor for a few dribbles effectively … Has very soft hands and makes contested catches … Works well as a lob man out of the pick-and-roll … Wingspan and frame allow him to finish at a high-rate around the basket … Slams home anything that comes within his catch radius … Mobile enough for a big man (if strength comes will see most time as a center at next level) … Defensively, is able to block shots due to his size and long arms … Excellent feel and timing as a help defender … Quick to recover and rotate on defense … Has improved every year at Wake Forest … Has received great coaching from Hall of Famer Danny Manning … Hard worker that leaves his all on the court … Appears to have a strong body frame to add weight and maintain a high level of mobility and athleticism …  ",": Aside from interior scoring and rebounds, doesn’t contribute much offensively … No outside game at all, has attempted just one three-pointer in two seasons at Wake Forest.

Donovan Mitchell,": Mitchell is undersized for an NBA two guard at 6’2”, but has a strong, filled out frame at 211 pounds that allows him to absorb contact well … What particularly stands out about Mitchell is his incredible 6’10” wingspan for a player his height, and has a 8’4 standing reach  … He also has tremendous speed and body control in the open court with big time athleticism that allows him to play much bigger than his size … He posted a 36½” no-step vertical at the NBA Combine and is especially explosive off of two feet … Mitchell’s unique physical profile gives him outstanding potential as a versatile scorer in both the half-court and in transition … He has long strides and is shifty and does an excellent job of powerfully changing speeds on his way to the basket … Mitchell can cover a lot of ground and with his length and he finish over the top of defenders and mix in creative finishes at the basket … Mitchell has become a much better perimeter shooter since his freshman year, increasing his percentage from 25% to 35% … His mechanics are smooth, with great balance, footwork and elevation on both his pull-up and spot-up jumper … He also has the potential to continue to improve in this area, especially when asked to play a simpler offensive role, with better shooters and spacing around him in the NBA. Mitchell demonstrates tough shot-making ability, and he impresses you with his ability create space off of crossovers, step-backs, hang-dribbles, etc … He also hit a strong 81% of his free throws this past season … Probably the most appealing part of Mitchell’s game lies on the defensive end … By the end of his second year at Louisville, he established himself as a multi-positional stopper who a coach can put on point guards, shooting guards and even some small forwards … Mitchell has outstanding physical tools to be a lockdown defender, with his elite length, strong frame and quick feet … Mitchell is also a highly competitive guy who is willing to pressure full court, dive to the floor for loose balls, and consistently make things difficult for opposing players … Mitchell has terrific instincts off the ball, as shown by his 2.6 steals per-40) … Despite being short for the average two-guard, his 6’10” wingspan is difficult for opposing guards to shoot over, and he does an exemplary job of using his quickness and strength to stay in front of his man … Mitchell’s intangibles are promising as well, and he will likely give NBA teams confidence in his ability to continue improving and reach his full potential … The strides he’s made with his shooting over the past few seasons speaks volumes about his work ethic … Mitchell also is a high character kid and a well-spoken individual … He has also reportedly shined in private interviews he’s conducted in the recent past …  ",": Mitchell is a much better leaper off of two feet than one foot, and his explosiveness on his drives diminishes when he has to elevate off of one foot, especially when forced to his weaker left hand … He also doesn’t get all the way to the rim as one might expect, as shown by his low two-point field goal percentage (46%) and below average free throw rate (4 attempts per-40), especially when operating against strong defenses … Despite a big 6’10 wingspan, his 8’1 standing reach is very small for an NBA 2-guard … Mitchell is still working on transitioning from the wing to the combo guard spot … He made strides as a playmaker in his sophomore season and operating out of the pick and roll … However, he still plays too fast at times, not always reading the defense and making the simple play … He also lacks the ideal height and court vision to see over the top of the defense, especially with bigger opponents guarding him … Even though he has improved as a shooter, Mitchell is still a streaky shooter, mostly due to his subpar shot-selection … He has a tendency to settle for tough, contested two-point jumpers, partially due to his inability to consistently get all the way to the rim, and also because of his average decision making skills … While he can make some of these attempts, it will not be a reliable way to score at the next level, and it will decrease his overall offensive efficiency, as it has in college …  ",6-2,210,SG,Louisville,So.,2017
TJ Leaf,": A versatile offensive player who shows the ability to play both inside and out … He has a European-like skillset and does a great job of exploiting mismatches on offense … Although he is not an advanced post player at this stage in his career, he has shown flashes of good footwork and a variety of post moves from the block … He has nice touch around the basket and effectively utilizes jump hooks, turnaround jumpers, and even an occasional dream shake … As a shooter, Leaf has good mechanics and is more than capable stretching the floor as a three-point shooter … He also demonstrates a solid mid-range pull up game, particularly from the elbows … He excels at taking bigger defenders off the dribble and does a great job of utilizing ball fakes from the perimeter … Leaf is not an elite athlete, but he is a good jumper off two feet and can finish above the rim consistently … Even though he isn’t the quickest laterally, he does a good job of moving his feet and using his size to stay in front of quicker guards … He also has solid defensive instincts and is a capable shot blocker … Two of Leaf’s strongest attributes are his high basketball I.Q. and his motor … He has also proven to be a clutch player who doesn’t get phased by a big moment or crowd (Rupp Arena) … Leaf moves well without the ball allowing him to get high quality shots … He’s also an excellent and willing passer for his size … Rarely does he force the issue, and he is almost always under control … He plays with consistent effort and regularly makes hustle plays, particularly on the offensive glass … Leaf is a terrific rebounder, which has a lot to do with how relentlessly he pursues the ball on both ends of the court … Leaf’s size, versatility, feel for the game, and motor make him a prospect with a high floor …  ",": The biggest area of concern for Leaf at this point is his lack of strength … He needs to add leg and core strength to better absorb contact and maintain balance … The good news is that he is only 19 years old and that there’s plenty of time for his frame to fill out … However, this hurts his ability to defend in the post where he can sometimes get pushed around … Although he is a capable finisher at the rim, he also struggles to finish through contact and does not have great body control when attacking the basket … As skilled as he is, rarely does he finish around the basket with his left hand … Leaf will need to improve in this area at the next level, or it will be much more difficult for him to score consistently … Right now he projects as more of a stretch four than a reliable go to option on the block … Leaf also doesn’t have great length and doesn’t really project as a rim protector at the next level … Although he has good instincts, he struggles defensively at times with longer and more athletic forwards …  ",6-10,225,PF,UCLA,Fr.,2017

Terrance Ferguson,": Ferguson has been somewhat forgotten over the past year as a result of his decision to forgo a season of college basketball and continue his career overseas for the Adelaide 36ers in Australia … However, Ferguson has been an electrifying player since his high school days where he finished as a top-20 national recruit and was selected for several prestigious high school all-star games including the McDonald’s All-American Game and the Nike Hoop Summit (where he went on a 3 point shooting barrage) … Ferguson’s combination of size and explosiveness immediately stand out and highlight his potential as an impactful NBA player … While he does not have elite length (6-9 wingspan), he has nice size for an NBA wing player at 6-7 … He also moves up and down the court with excellent fluidity with long strides and a quick, explosive first step … Where Ferguson particularly stands out, however, is his tremendous leaping ability in space, particularly off of one foot … He posted a 38” max vertical at the NBA Combine, and it is also worth noting that he won the Ballislife All-American Dunk Contest back in April 2015, after performing a free-throw line dunk … He has great straight line burst, which allows him to build momentum on his way to the basket and finish above the rim with ease … Ferguson’s athleticism comes into play in half court offense as well … Although, he is not a great shot creator, he gets great elevation on his mid range jumper and is able to shoot over the top of most defenders … He employs this ability frequently when working out of the post where he can face the basket and rise up for a routine jumper … This also gives him plenty of upside as a rebounder, and while he still has work to do to become a reliable factor on the glass, he has good motor and the necessary explosiveness to eventually be a consistent contributor in this area … He will especially be more effective on the boards as his frame fills out and he continues to get stronger, but he does a terrific job of compensating for his current lack of strength by almost always finding a man to box out when the shot goes up … Ferguson is also an excellent spot up shooter with potential for even further improvement with more repetition … He shot a very respectable 38.7% from distance this past season overseas, and he has great footwork before the catch with great elevation and a quick release … His shoulders are consistently squared to the basket, and he is almost always on balance when coming off  screens … His ability to get his feet under him and step into his shot with confidence before rising is picturesque … Ferguson also has decent upside as a defender thanks to his lateral quickness and competitiveness … He has terrific feet, can cover a lot of ground, and does well to stay in front of smaller players … While he lacks the requisite strength to be an interior defensive presence, he competes for position down low and does not back down against bigger players … He shows good skill in defending isolation on the perimeter, as he has good hip fluidity, and he works hard to force difficult shots … He also demonstrates great effort chasing shooters off of the three-point line, and he will press full court occasionally … There is still plenty of room for Ferguson to grow as well … Offensively, he shows flashes of playmaking ability and has some potential as a pull-up shooter too … On defense, once he improves his instincts he could become a real asset on that end of the floor as he already does a great job of flying around the ball and being active …  ",": One of the biggest concerns right now for Ferguson, as mentioned earlier, is his lack of an ideal frame … He checked in at the Combine at just 184 pounds, which causes him to struggle containing bigger guards … He also can get pushed out of position pretty easily and get caught on screens … This also causes him to get pushed out of his spots on offense, as he often is not able to get all the way to the rim without an open lane … Against bigger guards and wings, he allows his man to go right through him most times without showing much resistance … He also can be too upright, which somewhat mitigates his lateral quickness and athleticism … Even though he is competitive with big men down low on switches, he is too thin to be a true threat when defending them … On offense he is easily knocked off balance when going to the basket, and he shies away from contact, limiting his size advantage … Ferguson also rarely gets to the free-throw line (2.2 FTA per 40 minutes), and he still needs to refine his in between game to become a better all-around offensive threat … His ball handling skills are very limited, and he struggles to create space, especially against better defenders … Right now he is limited to mostly catch and shoot offense and straight line drives … He also has much room for improvement as a passer and initiating offense, as he turns the ball over much more frequently than he registers assists … As common for a young player, his feel for the game and instincts on both ends are just average … He averaged just 0.4 steals and 0.7 blocks per 40 minutes, which are numbers that should probably be much higher given his tools … He tends to get lost off the ball on defense, and tends to force a lot of passes as well instead of making the simple play … As a shooter Ferguson must become more consistent … This will probably determine if he becomes a solid contributor in the NBA … With his other limitations, he must be able to knock down perimeter shots consistently … He sometimes shoots on the way down, despite his excellent elevation on his jump shot, and he is a relatively poor free throw shooter (58.3%) …

Justin Patton,": A legit seven-footer … Has good agility and lateral quickness … Plus athlete for a player his size … Explosive off of the ground … Quick leaper, second jump was faster than others’ first in college … Can be a distraction at and around the rim defensively … Played well vertically in the interior … Also will be able to pluck away steals occasionally … Can switch out and defend guards on the perimeter … Doesn’t get out of his stance when faced against a guard and relies on his length and agility to smother smaller players … Best suited as a dive big man in a pick-and-roll heavy offense … Developed rapidly from a no-name recruit to up-and-coming college star … Shown a comfort shooting on the perimeter, yet isn’t likely to develop that part of his game … Needs to time to set his feet when shooting from outside … Much more comfortable taking outside shots in catch-and-shoot situations … Still raw, but has a refined set of moves when playing out of the post … Very effective finisher at the hoop on offense … Converts a lot of paint touches into points via above the rim play … Great in transition will run straight to the paint and then seal off his defender under the rim … Possesses the grace of a gazelle when he runs … Will beat most big men down the court in transition …  Good hands, can catch tough passes or convert inaccurate passes into points … Has nimble feet … Late growth spurt means he has some guard abilities in his game … Comfortable starting a break or making a few ball handling moves on the go with the ball … Has tons of potential and upside …  ",": Redshirt freshmen, will be 20 years old by the draft … Will need time to develop … Could end up spending the better portion of his rookie year in the D-League, rather than in the NBA … Very raw and needs to continue to build on the foundation of his game that he has … Has gotten stronger during his time at Creighton, but is still skinny for a big man, and may always be a bit on the thin side … Must show that he has the strength to bang and hold his own with NBA big men … Can get a bit dribble happy at times and will turn the ball over against pressure in the backcourt … Needs to fine tune a specific post move, often overthinks when on the block which leads to turnovers or missed shots … Rebounding and overall aggressiveness should improve with strength … 6.2 rebounds per game and 9.8 per 40 minutes, while decent, should be higher for a 7-foot center with his athleticism playing in the Big East … Added strength should allow him to get to the free throw line more as well. 2.5 trips to the line per game illustrate his lack of physicality … Shot just 51% from the free throw line. Will need to improve upon that as it’s far too low for a player with his shooting stroke …  ",6-11,230,C,Creighton,Fr.,2017
Jarrett Allen,": When looking towards the next level, Jarrett Allen’s size and length are some of the first things you notice when he’s on the court. Standing 6’10.5’’ in shoes, possessing an elite 7’5.5’’ wingspan, and a 9’2.5’’ standing reach, Allen’s ability to haul in rebounds will be one of his calling cards in the NBA … Through 22 games into his college career, Allen is pulling in a very respectable 8.4 rebounds per game, which includes a 2.9 split for offensive boards … His length, really allows him to get well above the rim with minimal effort … He’s also turned up his productivity during conference play, as he adjusts further to the NCAA game … Through 8 Big 12 games, Jarrett is pulling down 11 rebounds per game, which also included 3 straight double doubles in early Jan. Allen’s length will also allow him to protect the rim at the next level … He’s not an elite shot blocker, although good (1.6 bpg), but as he adds weight and experience, he has the ability to become a deterrent in the paint in the NBA … His immense length makes up for some deficiencies moving laterally, and he’s shown the ability to hedge successfully while defending pick and roll situations … Due to Shaquille Cleare playing the center for the Longhorns, Allen has actually played this season at the 4 spot for Shaka Smart … Allen’s ability to shoot in the mid range allows this, and it’s a nice piece of his offensive game when looking towards the NBA … Jarrett has a nice touch out to 12 feet, and good hands that allow him to catch passes around the rim, and finish at a good clip (68% at the rim according to hoop-math.com) … This foundation at such a young age make it reasonable to project him as being a player in the pick and pop game, as well as a solid roll man … His FT percentage is just 60%, but again, as he’s gained confidence throughout the season, he’s seen this element of his game improve. During Big 12 play, Allen is shooting 75% on a pretty decent 4.5 attempts per game. I wouldn’t go as far to say Jarrett projects as a high level offensive talent in the NBA, but his shooting touch gives him far more potential than many bigs his size who rely on athleticism alone to get buckets … Allen is a pretty good athlete as well … He’s a fast player for being near 7 feet tall, and is already 235 pounds. He appears to have the frame to add muscle, which he will need to do going forward.  ",": Jarrett Allen has good end to end speed, but he’s not particularly quick laterally, and possesses a bit of an awkward gate, as he hunches over when he runs … This is not particularly a huge issue, as I feel it could be corrected and improved as he gains strength and improves his conditioning … Allen still brings the ball down too much in the lane, which can lead to being stripped, and when he executes offense in the post it is often very slow and robotic … He’s very much a work in progress on offense, and despite his size and length advantage at the NCAA level, the game still appears to be pretty fast for him, and he doesn’t handle double teams well, nor instances in which he is heavily pressured … He is a solid passer in terms of knowing where to put the ball, but he often turns the ball over when defenders dial it up a notch … He’s also not the greatest in terms of boxing out, he’s good at picking the right spot, but is often muscled out by stronger players …  ",6-10,235,C,Texas,Fr.,2017
Frank Jackson,": Jackson’s ability to score the basketball is one of his biggest strengths … He shot 40% from three point range this season, was a reliable mid-range shooter and was an above average finisher at the rim … One glance at the McDonald’s All-American game dunk contest along with his combine performance will tell you that Jackson is a gifted athlete with a lot of leaping ability … Has a quick first step to burst by defenders and has some shifty fakes and handles to set up drives … His quick feet and explosiveness really helps his projections at the next level even though he doesn’t necessarily have an exact position …  He’s a physically gifted prospect with great size and length for the PG position in the NBA, and even has the size of a slightly undersized 2 guard …  A strong guard, very good legs with good body control that allows him to absorb contact and still get to his spots on the floor … Extremely high energy player with a great motor that helps him overcome some of his defensive lapses as he recovers well when beaten …  ",": No real defined position at this point in his career … Came to Duke as a PG but is really just more of a scoring guard at this point, and doesn’t have a great handle of the PG position … His 6’3 frame puts him into that dreaded category that no guard wants to be lumped into as he doesn’t have the size to defend NBA SG’s but doesn’t create for others in the way that you would want your PG to do … 1.7 to 1.4 a/to ratio is not what you want from a PG … His 2.7 assists per 40, which would rank him dead last among his peers in this draft, isn’t exactly ideal when it comes to your lead guard … That’s not to say he doesn’t have the ability to do so but when your mind is on putting the ball in the bucket, creating for others goes out the window … Luckily for him, he’s extremely efficient when he gives in to his scorer’s mentality …  By no means a poor defender but is limited on that side of the ball … Slides his feet well enough but doesn’t cut off driving lanes well and is subject to getting broken down off the dribble against quicker players … ",6-3,200,PG/SG,Duke,Fr.,2017
DJ Wilson,": Wilson was a late bloomer this season for Michigan, and he particularly broke out in the NCAA Tournament demonstrating numerous abilities that offer intriguing under the radar NBA potential … He was a key player in turning Michigan’s season around on their way to the Big Ten tournament title and a trip all the way to the Sweet 16 in March, after an up and down regular season … After averaging just 11 points per game in the regular season, he exploded in the tournament, averaging 18.5 points per contest and 3.5 blocks in three games, showing his ability to perform in big moments … At 6’10” and 240 pounds, he is quite a fluid mover and runs the floor very well in transition with long strides … He is also a good cutter without the ball, allowing him to get loose and get easy baskets at the rim … Wilson has good length with a 7’3” wingspan and can finish above the rim in space when receiving passes off of cuts or in transition … Wilson also demonstrates some good perimeter skills for his size, offering potential as a stretch four man in the NBA, which is essential nowadays for modern NBA big men … He has shown to be a dangerous pick and pop threat (37% 3s) and has good mechanics with a quick release and high release point … The defense has to respect his ability to catch and shoot, and he does a good job of attacking closeouts with his footwork and solid ball handling ability to counter when the defense prevents him from catching and shooting … Wilson is a good straight-line driver with both hands, but he likes to drive to his left so he can get to his floater with his right hand … He has good touch on his floater and is able to get his shot off over a lot of defenders with his size and length … Wilson has also shown a respectable face up post game and has an excellent face up jumper off of his inside pivot … He also has excellent footwork in the post and the ability to make jump hooks with either hand … On the defensive end, Wilson is rangy on the perimeter with the ability to keep smaller players in front off the dribble while still being able to contest jumpers with his length. He also has good closing speed on the perimeter and can chase guards off the perimeter due to his fluidity … He also has good lateral quickness and can switch/hedge out on ball screens and still recover … He also offers upside as a rim protector with his length and solid timing once he can refine his defensive awareness … He can also use his length to get in passing lanes and force turnovers off the ball.  ",": Wilson has some outstanding physical tools, but he still needs to learn how to maximize them with consistency … Often times instead of getting all the way to the rim and finishing with his length, he will settle for contested jumpers even when switched on a smaller player … He has a tendency to float on the perimeter when matched up with smaller players instead of posting up and using his size … He has great skill, but he will settle for a lot of contested jumpers early on in the shot clock … Wilson does not have great vision and can improve as a passer out of the post … He has a good handle for his size but will try to do too much at times and over dribble instead of relying on primary ball handlers, which leads to avoidable turnovers … Wilson needs to improve his physicality and toughness in the post, as he does not work hard to get good position against players his size … He also is not a great finisher in traffic and does not get to the free throw line that often (2.3 FTA per 40). He is skilled but he shies away from contact and mostly relies on finesse rather than physicality. He has great upside on the defensive end, but he needs to improve his awareness before he reaches that level … He can be late to hedge out on ball screens and often gets beat off the ball on cuts … He can do a better job of staying low and being in a good stance to maximize his explosiveness … He also does not always see the ball well, which makes him late to come over to the ball side and help out when needed, and he does not always jump to the ball from the weak side … The biggest thing he could improve upon, however, is his production on the glass … In 30 minutes of action last season, he averaged only 5.3 rebounds per game … With his combination of size, length, and athleticism, that number should be much higher … Improving his toughness and learning how to get good position down low will allow him to be much more of a factor here …  ",6-10,235,PF,Michigan,Jr.,2017
Jawun Evans,": After a promising freshman season cut short by injury, Jawun Evans came back and further established himself as both a dynamic scorer and distributor in the college ranks … Evans really has a good understanding of operating in the pick and roll, as well as artfully using screens to get a good shot … His ability to run an offense, understand spacing, and create for others will directly translate to the pro game … Jawun is also a strong shooter who hit 38% from deep during his sophomore campaign … His 81% clip from the free throw line, as well as a 48% percentage as a freshman paired with good mechanics and on court smarts would lead me to believe he will continue to improve from beyond the arc … His 19.2 points per contest were achieved on a variety of shots as well … Evans can get to the hoop, operate in the mid-range, and get out in transition. He also has a nice array of floaters and is good at creating space between defenders in order to get attempts up over shot blockers … While not an elite athlete, he is extremely quick and has pretty good lift … A glass half full observation would mention his 6’4’’ wingspan, which is helpful considering his small stature … Evans 6.4 assists per game lead the Big 12 this past season, and he did so with a pretty solid 2.28 assist to turnover ratio … Quick hands, and good anticipation also allowed him to rack up 1.8 steals per game as a sophomore … Evans has showcased the ability to take over games … He went for 25 or more points 8 times this past season did so without sacrificing his distribution duties … Jawun can be streaky as well. When he’s rolling he proved to often be too much to handle at the college ranks, and he does enough outside of scoring he’s still a valuable asset when his shot isn’t falling …  ",": Defensively Evans will have trouble at the next level … While 5’11.5’’ in shoes he does sport a nice wingspan, but he’s not overly strong for his size, nor is he an elite athlete … His effort is a plus, though, but he’ll be easy to shoot over in the NBA … Like many smaller guards, he also projects to struggle in the lane … According to hoop-math.com he shot just 50.4% at the rim against big men that will be much smaller and less athletic than their NBA counterparts … He didn’t enjoy the most efficient sophomore season … It should be noted that he carried a massive offensive load for the Cowboys, but 43% shooting in the NCAA isn’t a good clip, and things don’t get any easier in the NBA … A better shooting freshman season would give hope to turning things around when he’s not expected to shoot 15 times and be the primary ball handler and distributor, but he’ll also be playing against tougher competition …  ",6-0,185,PG,Oklahoma State,So.,2017
Kyle Kuzma,": Very light on his feet at 6’9” with great footwork; has very long strides, is a good transition player with solid feet on defense… Has the ability to allude defenders while moving towards the rim on the break … Has above average length and is quick to the ball on the glass … His agility at 6’9” allows him to get out on the break and run the floor well, and he also has the ability to push the ball up the court in transition as the ball handler … He is an excellent cutter and plays well without the ball in his hands, and while he is not overly explosive, he has the ability to finish above the rim in space … Kuzma is not the most advanced shot creator, but he excels at scoring on the move, particularly via straight line drives to the basket … He is a solid rebounder on both ends of the court, averaged 3 offensive boards per 40 minutes last season, often crashing the glass from the perimeter to pursue the ball … He also uses his length to be a factor around the rim and shows good instincts on the defensive glass and is quick to the ball … Even though he is not the most physically imposing player, he does a great job of consistently finding an offensive player to box out and has good timing on his jump … Kuzma has to refine his technique on defense but has good feet when locked in … He has the potential to be an effective pick and roll defender who can switch out on guards when necessary; has talent on the offensive end as both a scorer and a facilitator with potential as a stretch four man … He has excellent shot preparation and mechanics, soft hands, good touch around the basket, and solid vision … He is a better shooter than his percentages would indicate; only 29% in his career beyond the arc but has good footwork and a quick, fluid release … He can put the ball on the floor and attack the basket off the pick and pop … He can be a good isolation player, especially when his face up jumper is working for him … When the defense has to respect his jumper it opens up the rest of his offensive arsenal, where he uses jab steps effectively … He is willing to drive with either hand, and is also a good pick and roll player as the roll man … Kuzma is able to finish around the rim in a variety of ways with floaters and push shots due to his soft touch around the basket; his ambidexterity will be a big advantage at the next level … He needs to be under control more consistently but has talent as a passer, with the size to see over the top of defenders on the perimeter … He is also a good passer out of the post to weak side bigs or guards on the perimeter … Kuzma will fit well in today’s game as a perimeter oriented four man; still needs to work on his consistency but shows flashes of scoring and playmaking ability … He is not there yet defensively but has the potential to be an adequate multi-positional stopper … Jumpshot has good form and shows promise, his shooting is better than his numbers indicate and could be impacted to a degree by defenses collapsing on him … Fits the role of a new age stretch 4 …  ",": Kuzma shows a great deal of talent and skill but still needs to put it all together and sustain his intensity and focus; projects as a stretch four man but is a streaky shooter as this stage … He can also improve his ball handling skills and post game, and can be too wild with the ball in his hands; he will force the issue too often and can get too sped up and be turnover prone … Despite promising mechanics, the results are not there; he is only a 29% career three point shooter and a 59% career free throw shooter. He also does not have a very reliable mid range game or off the dribble jumper … As a projected four man, he will need to be more dependable in this area … It would probably help him to cut some of the motion out of his shot, as he tends to dip the ball all the way to his waist before getting into his release … He is a capable playmaker off the dribble, but his handle is a bit loose … Right now he is limited to mostly just straight line drives and is not great at making multiple moves or changing direction to create for himself … He can improve his feel in the low post, as he does not always do a great job of reacting to how the defense is playing him and seems too often to have his mind made up before he makes his move … He can also improve his shot selection … The three-point shot is not his greatest strength at this stage, but he will occasionally launch deep, low percentage shots from the perimeter, and also drives into traffic out of control too frequently … Kuzma has good vision but does not always play with his head up, which mitigates this ability … He can be forced into turnovers because of this, and he needs to do a better job of making the simple play instead of trying to force the issue … Kuzma was an adequate finisher in college but it will be a big adjustment against NBA length and athleticism; relies more on fluidity than explosiveness and struggles to elevate in traffic … He does not have the requisite size to compensate for his average explosiveness, and he will have to rely on touch and craftiness … He is a capable finisher through contact but struggles more with long defenders, which he will see much more regularly in the NBA; not a great stand still leaper; has good length and mobility at 6’9” but is not as effective defensively as he probably should be … He plays too upright on the perimeter causing him to struggle staying in front of smaller players … He can improve his toughness and develop more of a killer instinct on that end … He can get bullied inside, needs to do a better job of stopping the offensive player’s first move and force him to change directions … He does not show consistent effort when closing out on the perimeter, often too upright and will allow players to put the ball on the floor with his strong hand without showing much resistance … He struggles to contain the ball and usually will not attempt to make a play at the rim when beaten off the dribble … He can also get lost too often when he is off the ball; needs to do a better job of seeing both his man and the ball simultaneously … He can be a bit soft inside, and should be a much better shot blocker with his length … Motivation level remains a question mark. If he has a coach getting after him and improves his focus, his potential is substantial … ",6-9,225,PF,Utah,Jr.,2017
Harry Giles,": Giles is an extremely gifted athlete, arguably the best big man prospect in this entire draft when healthy, something he hasn’t been in quite a while … Looks the part of an NBA big man with his frame … An explosive leaper even with the injuries to his knees …  He’s got great hands which allows him to finish around the rim and in traffic …  He runs the floor well for a big man and is active on the glass … Shows a lot of physicality in the post and doesn’t shy away from contact on defense … Takes contact in the chest, isn’t easily moved off of his spots and is an above average rim protector … Moves his feet extremely well and has really good lateral quickness for a big man … Can play both the PF and C positions in the NBA from a defensive standpoint and while he is a work in progress on the offensive end, he has exhibited an ability to use a variety of post moves to score in the paint … Before his injury, he excelled in a face up game from about 15 feet and used his superior quickness, length and athleticism to get to the rim and finish with a purpose … The consensus top overall player in his class for years while in high , Giles has everything an NBA scout/GM could want from a prospect physically … A tremendous kid with a extremely outgoing and likable personality … ",": Multiple knee surgeries including two ACL tears (both knees) and an MCL tear (left) before graduating high school is a huge question mark with regards to the outlook of Giles’ career.  No team wants to draft the next Greg Oden and players with injury histories like that of Giles always raise red flags to scouts and GM’s who are putting their jobs on the line with every draft pick and free agent signing …  His ability to explode with contact seemed affected … As far as Giles’ looks on the court, he seemed to get lost at times during his freshman season and was almost afraid to do certain things … Whether that was simply due to a fear of another injury, lack of conditioning, Duke’s struggles in developing bigs, or an awareness thing remains to be seen … He isn’t a versatile player on offense and doesn’t really possess the range that you would like to see out of a PF even though that was always was he projected to be during his days in high school …  Doesn’t have great footwork or great touch on offense and relies heavily on put backs and dunks for most of his points …  His jumper is one glaring hole in his game as he routinely air balled or barely drew iron once outside of about 12 feet …  Doesn’t make great decisions on offense and hasn’t really learned to simply play within himself just yet … ",6-10,230,PF/C,Duke,Fr.,2017

Ivan Rabb,": There is plenty to like about Raab as a NBA prospect starting with his physical profile … He is a mobile big man with good size at 6’10” with a 7’2” wingspan and 9’1” standing reach, and he is light on his feet … Out of the pick and roll, he shows great agility as a roll man, and he can catch and finish lob passes in space … Rabb also runs the floor pretty well despite the limited opportunities he got playing in California’s slow tempo system … He is more mobile than most big men that guard him, which was displayed frequently by beating other bigs down the floor in transition … Rabb’s most established skill that will be a great asset for a team in the NBA is his rebounding ability … Posted 19 double-digit rebounding games this past season for Cal and averaged 12.8 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing good motor on the offensive glass as well (3.7 offensive rebounds per 40) … He also demonstrated one of the best pairs of hands in all of college basketball the last two years, which is shown by his ability to chase down rebounds out of his area … He has a large rebounding radius, great timing and instincts on his jump to corral missed shots, and he does an excellent job of finding a body when a shot goes up … He is also a great rebounder in traffic, as he does not shy away from contact down low and is aggressive pursuing the ball off the rim … Rabb has a blossoming post game both facing up and with his back to the basket … He also has improved his face up jump shot and is particularly difficult to guard when the defense has to respect his jumper … He shows flashes of excellent footwork and can finish at the rim from awkward angles with either hand . Rabb is also a big target in the post with his long arms and great hands. He is a bit streaky but definitely capable in the mid-range game, as he utilizes both jab steps and step backs to create separation into his shot. He is crafty in the post with his footwork and is particularly light on his feet when under duress down low … Also has an underrated basketball IQ, and has good feel for recognizing double teams and knowing when to pass out of them … He also has a good understanding of defensive positioning and handled the often-difficult moments at Cal quite maturely … He has good recognition off the ball on defense and does a good job of not fouling when coming over to help from the weak side … His above average ability to close out and defend bigs on the perimeter will help him in today’s NBA …  ",": Rabb is more of an old school post player and does not have ideal perimeter skills that NBA teams look for in a modern NBA big man … He does not space the floor with great consistency and shoots a flat ball at times … He will need to become more of a threat off the pick and pop to be a truly reliable offensive weapon in the league, and he must continue to improve as a free throw shooter (66%) … He also does not have the ball skills to create for himself on the perimeter, and most of his scoring will come in the post … He is much better as a straight-line driver, but when the defense takes this away, he is not fluid or skilled enough to utilize a counter move and create offense for himself effectively … He also struggles to attack closeouts off the pick and pop, which really limits him offensively … Lacks the strength to finish against NBA caliber big men with better length and athleticism … His skillset projects towards him being more of a center in the NBA, but he may not have the size and strength to be effective there … He can be knocked out of position pretty easily and does not have good body control against contact … This sort of tweener identity limits his defensive potential as well, as he is a tad small for the five and not quite rangy enough for the four … He is limited as a rim protector with only 1.3 blocks per 40 minutes, and could be a liability in the pick and roll when needed to switch out against smaller players …  ",6-10,220,PF/C,California,So.,2017

Deandre Ayton,": Tremendous physical profile (7’1”, 250 pounds) … Fits the profile of a physical freak and a ""Generational center"" … Figures to be among if not the top center in the league in his prime … Already has an NBA ready body, and a physique ideally designed for the game of basketball … Moves exceptionally well for his size … Runs the floor well and really excels in the transition … Plays physical, showing a willingness to bang and seek out contact … He’s capable of reliably hitting open jumpers, even developing a three-point game (34.3% on 1 attempt per game) … Has very good hands … Has good form on his shot, shooting 73.3% from the foul line … Knows how to score in a variety of ways: Around the rim, mid-range, and beyond (20.1 points per game) … Developing solid post moves and has exceptional footwork … Good in both pick and roll and pick and pop situations … While able to dunk in traffic with ease, he isn’t overly reliant on his physical gifts to score … Does a good job controlling the glass and the paint, averaging 11.6 rebounds and 1.9 blocks per game … Very active on the offensive glass, good at getting tip-ins and put backs … Has a really quick second jump and follows his own misses really well … Does a good job defending without fouling (2.3 fouls per game) … Seems to be NBA ready from a mental standpoint … Was comfortable handling the work load night in and night out at Arizona … Pretty consistent player, giving good energy every minute he’s on the floor … Rarely had an off night.

But has developing skills to operate both on the block and facing the basket. Has a lot of natural ability and his post game can advance tremendously if he’s given the proper instruction …  ",": Defensive awareness needs to improve. For a player with such elite physical gifts, his shot blocking ability is curiously average (though he seemed to improve as freshman season progressed). He should be able to improve upon this over time, given the proper coaching and desire … Needs to do a better job guarding against the pick and roll. Can sometimes lose his man … Needs to do better as a help defender … Can get flat footed at times … And seemed to look to preserve energy (and fouls) on the defensive end … While capable of scoring at all three levels, jumper (inparticular shot selection) still needs improvement … Tends to shoot it a bit short and at times can rush his shot … Needs to follow through and also look to improve his touch around the basket … Needs to do a better job of commanding the ball inside and establishing position. He’s so big and strong that he will be very difficult to stop from extablishing position at the next level once his strength peaks out and he fully understands utilizing position and getting low … Sometimes is a bit passive and can be lazy at times, though he played with a solid level of energy for the most part throughout his college career …  Needs to do a better job contesting shots on the perimeter … Needs to do a better job scoring in traffic … If crowded, you can bother him and force him to take a difficult shot or turn the ball over … Will need to improve ability to handle double teams …  ",7-0,260,C,Arizona,Fr.,2018

Luka Doncic,": Versatile all around guard/forward who can do just about everything on the court … Probably the most mature prospect that Europe has seen in years … His Basketball I.Q is off the charts … A natural born leader, excels under pressure, who takes and makes big shots … Not afraid of the big stage, since he has been the center of attention since he was 15 years old … He has been used as a point guard from young age and really knows how to control the tempo of the game … Looks like he will become a point forward in the future … Not very gifted athletically, but has some sneaky athleticim and length that helps him blow by opponents and make athletic finishes … Great size for a wing … Has really bulked up considerably the last few years and has lost some baby fat that he was carrying … Has great feel for the game … Very good ball handler, with a nice crossover and step back dribble on his repertoire… Nice hands that help him in all aspects of the game… Already a very good scorer, he can score in every way possible… When he gets hot is really difficult to stop him… Great shooting mechanics and good looking shooting form… His Pull-up game and shot of dribble are lethal… He is a threat on Spot Up and Catch and Shoot situations… Attacks closeouts and can either go all the way to the hop or stop and shoot… Knows his way around the screens and uses them excellent… Has the ability post-up smaller opponents and punish miss-matches with a variety of moves thanks to his good footwork… Drags bigs away from the basket on switches and tries to exploit any advantage on his favor… Can be effective without the ball in his hands… Good Free Throw shooter… Elite passing skills and court vision… He can pass from anywhere on the floor and everywhere on the floor since he is a really creative passer… Great passer on the move to the weakside, he can already make one hand passes… A true maestro in Pick and Roll situations as the ball handler, he is the dream of every rolling Big… After he receives a pick he can either find the rolling Big, pass to the weakside, go all the way to the basket, or shoot off the dribble… There isn’t a cover he hasn’t faced already, so he is really not surprised anymore against defenses… Great body control and balance on drives… He can penetrate from either side and finish to the basket with strong or finesse lay-ups and even some dunks when he finds room and jump of two feet… Excels in tranistion as a ball handler thanks to his amazing court vision, basketball I.Q and scoring ability… Very good rebounder for his position, especially on the defensive end… Adequate lateral quickness… Doesn’t back down on Defense and tries to make it difficult for his opponent to post him up… Smart help defender who knows where to stand, anticipating plays before happen…  ",": He can be considered magrinally average athlete by NBA standards … Not overly long, more of an average actually…  His first step is slow even for European standrards … Not a very good leaper of one foot, his good jumps come of two feet … Must continue working on his body … He lost some flexibility while he was bulking up … Can be really emotional at times and lose concentration for a few plays… He can depend too much to his instict at times … If he doesn’t have momentum it’s difficult for him to finish plays at the rim… He must improve in changing speeds and pace … His ball handling still needs some polishing, especially with his left hand … Has problems against aggressive ball pressure from smaller, faster opponents … The lack of explosiveness makes it really difficult for him to create his own shoot against great athletes with good wignspan … Isn’t always able to punish switches when he has a versatile Big against him, especially if there are no shooters around him … He has the tendency to over-dribble, trying to find his way around his defender, icing-out teammates momentarily … It’s a questionmark whether he will be able to create consistently at the next level on ISO situations … Finds it difficult to finish in traffic and against elite length … Finishing against contact might be an issue at the next level … Shooting selecion can become a little iffy occasionally with some off balance shoots and long floaters … Can fall in love with his pull-up game and settle too much against switches … Kind of streaky shooter for now … Incosistent 3-point shooter … Must have feet set to shoot well in Catch and Shoot situations … His off the ball game should still improve a little bit more … The fact that he can see angles that no one else can see leads to some extreme passes and, as a consequence, some turnovers… His assist/turnover ratio could be better … He could be more involved on the offensive boards … Doesn’t always box out and depends on instict and position to grab defensive rebounds … He is not always engaged on defense … He should raise his intensity on the defensive end … Doesn’t keep a low stance all the time when he is guarding a ball handler , which makes it easier for his opponent to blow by him … It’s a questionmark who he could guard at the next level, since he has problems against smaller, quicker opponents, but also against athletic wings … Not always physical enough when he is defending in the post … Has problems reading screens on the defensive end … Has been targetted on

Mohamed Bamba,": A truly elite physical specimen in terms of length, Mohamed Bamba jumps off the page with his 7’9” wingspan and 9’6” standing reach … This kind of size allowed him to immediately burst on to the NCAA scene as an elite rim protector with the measurables to translate this skill to the NBA … Blocking 3.7 shots per game during his regular season stint at Texas doesn’t even take into account the countless shots he altered or drive attempts he thwarted … Timing is a part of this, as he only averaged 2.4 fouls per contest at the college level … His lateral quickness is also very good for a player who measures in at 7 feet tall. This makes him a capable pick and roll defender and someone who roam the entire paint area with little effort … From a rebounding standpoint, his 10.4 boards per game as a freshman is well above average, and despite his narrow frame he held his own pretty well in the paint against stronger opponents … While Bamba will always be a lean player, he does have wide shoulders and looks to be able to add muscle … His 3.2 offensive rebounds per contest is also a very good indicator of timing around the rim … Mo Bamba’s offensive game is probably a little further along than you might initially think … He is a 67.8% free throw shooter, and has a nice high release and good backspin on his shot … In an era when long, defensive bigs are often poor free throw shooters, Mo appears to have the foundation to be pretty good at the charity stripe … His jump shot is also showing signs of life as Bamba shot 28% from the college 3 point line, and showed to be capable from the elbow, while showing decent shot selection … While his jumper and 3 point shot are not exactly calling cards at this point in his development, I’d still call his foundation as a shooter an strength overall … He’s also a decent ball handler for a big man, and has shown some impressive glimpses of his length and athleticism when putting the ball on the deck and driving past and then dunking on defenders … He plays with fire, and at the college level when he gets good position and is close to the rim he’s extremely tough to stop … Bamba definitely projects as a defender first at the next level, but he has the pieces in place , with continued development, to be a force on offense as well … An extremely bright individual, if not for basketball, he had Ivy league grades and credentials entering college … ",": As obvious is as length is, it’s also not hard to notice he’ll need to continue to add strength to play the paint in the next level …  At the 2017 Hoop Summit, he only weighed in at 216 pounds … Ideally, you’d like to see Bamba at least around 240 in a year or two, or possibly 250 … I think those weights are achievable for him judging by his length, and how he’s added muscle since high school … His awareness with his back to the basket and in the paint on offense is a work in progress too … He’ll need to continue to work on his awareness of spacing and cutting players, as well as adjusting to double teams and pressure from guards … When he’s feeling it offensively, he could take over a game at the college level, but he could also be too passive when he’d get bothered … Restraint is good from a team game perspective, but with his physical tools he should have been more aggressive at times while playing for the Longhorns … A solid athlete, but much of his wow factor is due to length and not explosiveness or leaping ability … ",7-0,225,C,Texas,Fr.,2018
Trae Young,": Trae Young early on in his freshman season is doing things that college basketball fans rarely see … Through Oklahoma’s first ten games, he averaged nearly 30 points and nine assists per game, which is unheard of for any player let alone a freshman … Young has also yet to score fewer than 22 points since the season opener … Young is just the fourth high-major freshman guard in seven years to record a usage rate higher than 30 percent … Two of those players, D’Angelo Russell and Markelle Fultz, were top-two draft picks … The first thing that jumps out about Young is his seemingly limitless shooting range … Young is a threat to score from anywhere on the court once he crosses half court and can effortlessly knock down shots beyond the NBA three-point line … He may be the best shooter in college basketball since Stephen Curry played at Davidson … What separates Young from other great shooters is that, like Curry, he has the ability to knock down shots from distance off a variety of dribble moves and not just off the catch or off of simple one-dribble pull ups … He has a quick, compact release with minimal wasted motion that allows him to get his shot off even in tight space … Young’s jumper unlocks numerous other options offensively for him … Although he is not the most explosive athlete, the threat of his jumper forces defenders to guard him way out on the perimeter, making it easier for him to get by his man and into the paint … Young has shown the ability to create his own shot from inside the arc with a solid handle … He has a great floater from the mid range area as well that he can score with consistently when he is not able to get all the way to the rim … Young’s ability to operate out of the pick and roll is very advanced for a player of his age … He makes great decisions and quick reads off of ball screens and is always under control … Young always plays with his head up in these situations and shows great vision in the half court and in transition … He puts his passes on target and in spots on the court where his teammates are comfortable playing … He also does a nice job of not forcing passes and making the simple play when nothing extra is needed … In transition, Young does an excellent job of leading the break and is dangerous due to his combination of vision and craftiness around the rim … When he goes to the basket, he is adept at using his body to shield himself from bigger defenders and finish through contact … He can score with both hands or dish it to open teammates to lead to an easy basket.   ",": Young does not have ideal size at 6-2 or length with just a 6-2 wingspan for an NBA guard … These physical limitations can become apparent once he gets all the way to the rim … He lacks the length and vertical explosiveness to finish through NBA length and athleticism and does not project as an efficient scorer at the basket in the NBA … He will have to rely much more on craft to be successful inside at the next level … He has been a bit turnover prone at times this season due to his tendency to make some risky passes at times … However, much of that is due to his unusually high usage rate, and he still has an assist to turnover ratio of better than two to one … Young’s shot selection at times leaves a lot to be desired … As good of a shooter as he is, there are times where he will hoist a very long jumper early in the shot clock without moving the ball and looking for a better opportunity first … As polished as Young is offensively, he is a near liability on defense … He rarely gets into a stance on this end of the floor and shows poor effort guarding the ball … Opposing guards are easily able to get into the lane against him and he is often caught ball-watching when his man does not have the ball … Due to his lack of ideal size and athleticism, he will be a guy for opposing offenses to attack … He is not explosive enough to stay in front of quick guards, and he is also not big enough to stop anyone else on the court … The effort has to improve first and foremost, but even if it does he may never be a reliable defensive player unless he can create a high number of steals … Will need to add strengh to be able to better finish off drives and also defend …   ",6-2,180,PG,Oklahoma,Fr.,2018
Wendell Carter,": NBA-ready body/strong frame … Carter is 6’10,"" 251 pounds with a 7′ 4.5” wingspan and a 9’1 standing reach … His substantial size/physical profile suggests that he has more than enough size to play at the center position full-time in the small-ball NBA … Offers a multitude of skills on both ends of the floor … He has great hands for a young big man … Highly coordinated and mobile on both ends of the floor … His offensive skill set is as versatile and polished as any other big man in the 2018 draft class … He consistently showcased the ability to score efficiently against high-level college competition … Powerful post player with agile footwork … He excels playing with his back to the basket … Loves to spin baseline … Has finesse in his game … Possesses an array of effective post moves … Can knock down jumpers facing up … Quick first step … Good handle on the ball for a big guy … He’s effective off-the-dribble from the face-up position – gets the rim and finishes … Attacks closeouts strong from the perimeter … Can finish through contact … Proved to be a strong/efficient scorer at the rim – shooting 56 percent from the field overall … Moves well without the ball, gets to the right spot, and does a great job carving out position in the lane and imposing his will on his defender … Has excellent timing when it comes to positioning himself for catch-and-dunk opportunities off guard penetration … Can consistently knock down jumpers from the post area and from mid-range … Shoots the ball with confidence … Has a soft touch on his jumper/shooting mechanics look clean … Stretch big potential … His jumper extends to the three-point line he hit 41 percent of his 46 total three-point attempts at Duke) … Can shoot off the catch and off 1-2 dribbles … Knocked down 74 percent of his free throws (great number for a big) … He has play-making upside … Willing to pass the ball/makes good passing decisions out of the low/high posts … Can throw skips from the post, drive-and-kick out of face-ups, and execute big-to-big interior passes … Moves the ball quickly to avoid double teams … Has shown the ability to pass on the move … Does a terrific job setting screens for his teammates … Knows how to play high low, seals his man when guard penetrates his way … Does a great job making plays either rolling to the basket or popping out towards the perimeter after setting screens … Defensively, he showed solid footwork in the post as well as good instincts … His length and vertical jumping ability paid dividends for him as a rim protector … Has shot-blocking prowess and solid overall defensive awareness … Jumps with his body and arms straight up to block shots … Disciplined about rotating to the rim and challenging shots … Tremendous rebounder – would have averaged more rebounds had he not been playing alongside Marvin Bagley III … Effective at clearing out space in the paint with his thick body to go for boards … Simply overpowered his opponents on the glass … Once a shot goes up, he recognizes the best position for him to secure the rebound and boxes out his man really well … Has a nose for the ball … Uses his rebounding instincts/motor to pull down loose balls in traffic and convert them into second-chance points …Very fundamentally sound player overall … Has a high basketball IQ/feel for the game … A good understanding of angles … Tough, physical player who doesn’t mind mixing it up inside … Runs the floor well/with long strides … ",": Good athlete, but he lacks elite athleticism and isn’t considered a run and jump athlete … Does not possess high-end burst, explosiveness, or foot speed (although that could potentially change and improve if he stays in shape/work on his body fat, which was measured at a subpar 7.85 percent at the combine) … Perimeter defense is a question mark … Needs to improve his agility as a perimeter defender … Typically moves well when going from east-west, but not so much when he has to change direction going north-south … May struggle to guard against small-ball lineups in the NBA, especially against quicker players in the pick-and-roll … Can help his team way more defensive if he becomes more willing to do the little things on that end of the floor … Shows flashes of being a good shooter and has solid mechanics, but he still needs to gain consistency from the floor and the foul line … Struggles shooting when he’s pressured and forced to release too soon (needs time and space to get his shot off) … His lack of burst, dynamic leaping ability, and above-the-rim play-making ability could become a challenge when trying to score against NBA size … Finishing in traffic can stand to improve (not a crafty finisher) … Not a transition finisher and seems to jump better off two feet … He’s a bit turnover and foul prone … 6’10"" height is considered to be undersized for a center, but it depends on the match-ups and if he’s playing against a small-ball lineup … His average size may make his team play him at power forward, where he wouldn’t be as good a fit as at the center position … Does a good job passing the ball right before double teams come, but if he waits too long, he doesn’t have the size to easily see over the top and can get rushed under pressure … Has relatively small hands for a bigman … Lacks the upside of some his fellow big men in his draft class (i.e. DeAndre Ayton, Mo Bamba, Jaren Jackson Jr., Marvin Bagley III) ",6-10,250,C,Duke,Fr.,2018
Collin Sexton,": Sexton is one of the most dynamic guards in the country and has the tools to become a versatile weapon at the NBA level … Although he is slightly undersized in height at 6-2, he plays with great physicality, athleticism, and aggression, and has a 6’6.5 wingspan and a 8’0 standing reach … He’s a player that loves the spotlight and seems to be energized by the bright lights and stiff competition … He loves to play through contact and has the frame to absorb it when going to the rim … He has the strength and athleticism to finish through contact, and he also gets to the free throw line at a very high rate … Sexton still could stand to become more consistent from the charity stripe, but overall he converts his attempts at a more than proficient level … Sexton combines his strength with blazing speed, agility, and creative ball handling to form a lethal slashing arsenal … He does a great job of finding angles to get to the basket and changing directions to keep his defender off balance … Sexton also does a good job of changing speeds on the perimeter when coming off of ball screens or in isolation … That allows him to keep his man guessing and much more easily get into the lane … Sexton is constantly in attack mode looking to make a play … His wiggle off the dribble naturally leads him to make a play either for himself or a teammate … Sexton’s jumper also looks promising, as he combines his ability to get to the rim with a variety of moves on the perimeter … He utilizes step backs, pull-ups, and even some mid range fallaways … He is a dangerous scorer in the mid range area, and even though that is not an essential part of today’s game, the best scorers all excel in this area … While not a pass first point guard, he has the prerequisite vision and playmaking ability needed to be an NBA floor general … He is a great facilitator in transition, and his ability to get into the lane in the half court allows him to collapse the defense and find open teammates all over the floor … His aggressive style combined with his explosiveness point towards high upside on the defensive end at the next level … Sexton also is not afraid of the big moment and does not back down from tougher competition … He plays with tremendous passion and seems to perform his best in big games … With his two-way skillset and determination, Sexton has a chance to be a quality lead guard in the NBA …  ",": Sexton still has some room for improvement as a slasher despite his explosiveness … He has the ability to finish with his left hand at the rim but is obviously much more comfortable going right at this stage … He needs to add a bit more finesse to this department in his game, as he will not be able to rely on sheer athleticism once he reaches the NBA … His shot selection could also use some polishing … He tends to force the issue at times and often tries to make the flashy play instead of keeping it simple … While Sexton has proven to have excellent shot making ability, his balance on his jumper is not always consistent … He is more of a streaky shooter than a pure knockdown threat at this point … Sexton is much more of a combo guard than a true point guard, which could hinder his ability to run a team at the next level … His assist turnover ratio is below two to one, which is less than ideal for a lead guard in the NBA … He will need to develop into more of a facilitator to maximize his offensive efficiency at the next level … He also has a tendency to become a bit stationary without the ball in his hands, so his activity off the ball can improve …  ",6-2,185,PG,Alabama,Fr.,2018
Kevin Knox,": Solid frame, standing 6’9”, 218 pounds, with 7.14% body fat … Size and length can result in matchup problems for opposing teams. 7’ ¼” wingspan.  36 ½” vertical allows him to rebound over smaller players with relative ease … Has solid shot mechanics that should translate well to the next level as he already has NBA range … Is very good at scoring going to the basket, especially with one handed floaters that he can get over virtually any defender … Can score from the post, allowing for a versatile offensive attack … Steady improvement throughout his freshman season. Started off poorly on defense to start his college career, but has shown significant growth, especially in terms of staying in front of ball handlers … Looks to get out in transition when given the opportunity and runs lanes well for the most part, and looks to get to the rim … Rarely makes careless passes and doesn’t stagnate the offense by over dribbling … Moves well off the ball and uses off ball screens very well to create separation from defenders … Excellent catch and shoot player from midrange, especially along the baseline … Can shoot over most defenders and is not afraid to look for his own offense … When he needs to rebound, can rebound very well … Won’t turn 19 until August 11th. One of the youngest freshmen in college this season, and still has a lot of room to grow … Reason to believe that his game will develop … Has the potential to be a solid all around player that can do many different things … ",": Motor can run hot and cold, when engaged he is very good, but when not fully engaged he can disappear completely … His overall game can be affected by his shot, when the shot isn’t falling he can start to lose focus … Possesses poor court vision mainly due to keeping his head down when handling the ball, which can lead to turnovers and offensive fouls … Rarely passes the ball in transition, even if it results in him attacking the rim in a 3-on-1 situation … Will be at a speed and quickness disadvantage against small forwards at the next level … When the offense goes through other players, he will often coast instead of focusing on rebounding or defense … Has a tendency to force or settle for long shots instead of attacking defenders … Has only one move in the post, will need to develop his repertoire further to have success on the low block at the next level … Not a very efficient player, although some of that is because Kentucky’s reliance on him offensively, allowing defenses to key on him … Doesn’t have a noticeable killer instinct or edge to him, sometimes looks content to blend, instead of stand out despite having an immense amount of talent … Struggles at times to create his own offense as he has difficulty getting past opponents.

Mikal Bridges,": Prototypical 3-and-D wing for the next level … 6-7 guard/forward with elite length, athleticism and skill set … Has evolved from being a defensive standout to one of the best outside shooters and wings on the college level … Quite possibly the best two way player available in this year’s draft, and figures to be one of the most NBA ready as well … Hits three pointers at a high volume, 2.5 three pointers on just under 6 shots per game … Has a very polished 3-point shot. Great form, accuracy and confidence in his shot: Gets his feet set quickly, has a quick release, good elevation, follow through, and shows range and consistency … Does most of his damage offensively as a spot up shooter … Nearly 50% of his shots come from behind the 3point arch where he is extremely efficient (43% from 3)… Has improved his ability to attack the rim off the bounce and finish with dunks … A +6 or +7 length body type … His 7-foot wingspan allows him to get shots off with ease as well as being a difficult match up on the defensive end … Excels on the defensive end and is disruptive with his great length … Gets in a low defensive stance and covers a lot of ground making it difficult for opponents to get clean looks … Doesn’t gamble for steals and has learned to play sound, fundamental defense after 4 years under Jay Wright at Villanova. He plays the passing lanes well, and is tough to get shots off on due to his length … An extremely efficient overall offensive player shooting (51.6 fg%, 42.9% 3p, and 84.7% ft) … Has improved considerably in his junior season going from a key role player to a star (10 ppg to 18 PPG) on the college level and Villanova’s go-to athletic scorer … Has become known for being a clutch shooter, and seems to elevate his play in big moments … Level headed player who rarely loses his cool … Solid decision maker, 2.1/1.4 a/to rate …  ",": The biggest knock on Bridges is his lack of strength. Not an overly physical player … His 2.8 FTs made on 3.4 attempts show that he doesn’t attack the rim and get to the line a great deal. His FTA/FGA ratio is below 30% at 28.0% … Has worked hard at adding muscle mass, but remains on the thin side at 210 lbs for a player about to turn 22. Could stand to add another 10 lbs, which would help him to finish through contact and play more physical at both ends. Though he may be a player that lacks the natural body type to carry more weight … He would also better utilize his great free throw shooting ability by playing more physical and attacking the rim … Playing alongside one of the nation’s best point guards (Jalen Brunson) for his entire college career has been a huge positive for Bridges, but it has also kept him from having to develop as an isolation player … Has displayed some ability to get to the rim off the bounce and pull up, but remains more of a catch and shoot guy than a driver (96.4% of his 3 pointers come off of assists) … Took some time to break into a star … Red-shirted the 2014-15 season, practicing with the team … Will turn 22 on August 30th, and therefore has maturity but less upside than a number of his fellow draft prospects… Foot speed is solid, especially laterally, but not exceptional … A good leaper but not great with contact and struggles some to finish after contact or rebound in traffic despite his length … Generally goes right, so could improve upon attacking off the dribble using his left hand … Vision and passing a work in progress. Not really a facilitator or a guy that creates open looks for teammates with the drive and dish … More of a lead by example type, could work on being more vocal now that he’s one of the team’s stars … ",6-7,210,SG/SF,Villanova,Jr.,2018

Miles Bridges,": It was not too long ago that a tweener type of player like Miles Bridges was difficult to find a distinct role in the NBA … Over the last couple of years though, the dynasty that the Golden State Warriors have built has transformed basketball into a positionless game where players like Bridges are now the pivotal role players to which every team wants to build themselves … A player like Bridges is perhaps the most important piece of this new positionless puzzle: a two-way wing player who can play multiple positions in various lineups … The intrigue with Bridges begins with his NBA-ready frame and incredible explosiveness … Bridges might be the draft’s top athlete, between his quickness, power and leaping ability … At 6′ 6"", 230 pounds, he’s built similarly to Jae Crowder or PJ Tucker … Like Crowder, he will also be an asset on the defensive end in today’s game because he can guard positions 2 through 4 … He’s quick enough around the perimeter to chase around guards with the strength to match up against bigger forwards … He’ll have the chance to be a tough one-on-one defender like Crowder, but Bridges, who blocked 1.5 shots a game at Michigan State, will also be an exciting defensive playmaker for his ability to chase down fast breaks and fly in from the weak side … Bridges will probably never be an elite offensive playmaker or shot creator, but his catch and shoot ability will at least make him a threat … Bridges connected on almost 38 percent of his threes in two collegiate seasons and also shot 85 percent from the free throw line as a sophomore … His lefty mechanics are smooth with little wasted motion, and he has good footwork and shot preparation before the catch … He also can get himself easy baskets with his athleticism off straight-line drives, cuts and in transition … He is also a deft passer at 3.6 assists per 40 minutes, and he also had a positive assist-to-turnover ratio at Michigan State … He has a solid feel for the game and does a nice job of making the simple play off of the catch and in pick-and-roll situations … Bridges is also a very high-level rebounder for a wing and uses his strength and athleticism to get involved on the glass on both ends … Bridges does not shy away from big moments and has proven to be a clutch player in late game situations … He is a very competitive player with a high motor on both ends of the court …  ",": Bridges is not a great ball handler and can get sloppy with his dribble in the half court … He does not project as a primary ball handler or shot creator at the next level and is more of a one or two dribble player instead of a playmaker. Bridges is listed by Michigan State as 6-7, but his last official measurements had him at 6-6 with a 6-9 wingspan … The lack of height makes him undersized as a small forward and well undersized at the 4 … He also does not have ideal length, which may hinder his ability to be as disruptive as a defender in the NBA against longer and more athletic players … Despite his explosiveness, he does not get great lift on his jumper, which will generate questions about whether he will consistently be able to get his shot off against longer defenders in the NBA … Bridges is also somewhat limited by his lack of a pull-up jumper and mid-range game … The likelihood Bridges will develop into an offensive focal point who can create consistently for himself and others seems low … It’s not a role he played in either season for the Spartans, and most future wing creators tend to show flashes of this at some point in college … ",6-6,220,SF/PF,Michigan St.,So.,2018
Jerome Robinson,": Shooting guard with excellent ball skills … One of the draft’s top shooters … Hit 40% from 3 (2.3 of 5.7 per game), 83% FT shooter … Has a very clean release, excellent form on his shot … Had a great synergy with teammate Ky Bowman and did most of his damage off the ball as a spot up shooter … Adept at creating shots off the dribble … Very crafty at setting up shots with the use of pump fakes and change of momentum to get defenders off balance and free himself for open looks … An excellent ball handler and very good at shooting off the dribble … Good catch and shoot player, gets set quickly, has a fast and effective release … Has a polished step back move that makes him hard to guard on the perimeter … Imaginative offensive player … Incorporates runners well when necessary, which is helpful considering his size and explosiveness is good but not to the point that he can challenge bigs at the rim … Had some impressive thunderous dunks in games as a junior, showing the ability to dazzle when he gets an open window to the rim … Has a good feel for the game. Understands how to facilitate the pick and roll … Aggressive on the break, attacking the rim and drawing fouls … Solid defender though strength will help at the next level … Deceptive leaper … Slick ball handler with deadly crossover to rock defenders off balance and set up drives or shots outside … Has a lot of wiggle and shake when attacking the rim with momentum … A/TO ratio was 3.3/2.7, solid for a 2-guard …  ",": Already a junior so a little older than your average first round prospect (Turned 21 in February) … Not especially explosive off the dribble … Not a great ISO player … First step isn’t elite making it harder for him to make quick defenders pay for crowding him … Ability to create is solid however much of his offense came within the flow of team’s offense.

Michael Porter,": Michael Porter Jr.’s situation is unique due to his minimal college basketball experience … However, he was a highly regarded prospect out of high school and is still in the conversation to be a top-five pick … Porter’s case centers around his unique blend of size, athleticism and advanced skill … At 6-10 with a 7-0 wingspan and 9-0 standing reach, he has the frame to be one of the league’s most physically gifted combo forwards … For perspective, Porter’s standing reach is equal to what Anthony Davis measured at the draft combine in 2012 … Porter combines fluid athleticism with comfort as a ball handler, three-level scorer and flashes of playmaking and defense … His physical tools make him a unique prospect in a draft class lacking top wing prospects … The fact that there is also an increasingly high demand for versatile two-way wings in today’s NBA further augments his value … Porter’s advanced offensive skillset will allow him to carve out a key role on an NBA team in some way or another … Although he performed poorly in his two full college games, this was likely due to rust, and his shooting numbers from his final season in the Nike EYBL are promising … Porter connected on 36.1 percent of his 3-point attempts while hoisting 5.4 per 40 minutes … He also shot 84 percent from the foul line on over 10 attempts per 40 minutes … Porter has a very high release point that makes it difficult for defenders to contest … He also has very smooth mechanics and gets excellent rotation on the ball with deep range when his feet are set … He can also make a variety of difficult shots from all over the floor … NBA offenses aren’t always capable of generating the perfect shot, so when things break down, having a player like Porter can be useful … Porter also shows flashes of solid playmaking … He occasionally whips passes down quickly into the post, finds rollers, moves the ball for better shots and uses his height to dump passes over the defense … Porter has potential to become a multi-positional defender who can help on the defensive glass, as evidenced by the 16.6 rebounds per 40 minutes he grabbed in the Nike EYBL … He also averaged 6.7 rebounds per game in 17.7 minutes per contest in three games played at Missouri …  ",": Porter needs to continue to add strength … His catch-and-shoot motion includes a heavy load-up and sometimes a long dip before getting into his motion … He must quicken his release against longer defenders in the NBA … While Porter certainly shows the ability to create for himself, especially in transition where he can really use his long strides and athleticism, he is less effective in the half court … He has a decent first step, can carve out space at the rim with good upper body strength and is a creative finisher around the basket, but he lacks the necessary advanced dribble moves to separate from quality defenders on a consistent basis … Porter also has room to improve in terms of getting others involved … Although he averaged 3.7 assists per 40 minutes for MoKan Elite in the summer of 2016 and has decent court vision, he often gets tunnel vision and dribbles with his head down … He also averaged only 0.3 assists in three games at Missouri … Porter is also very inconsistent defensively at this stage … At times, his size and mobility are overwhelming for smaller opponents, but occasionally, he can be lackadaisical in making rotations and getting back in transition … His lateral quickness also isn’t great, and he doesn’t always sit down in a stance … The burning question that will dominate all of those on-court questions, though, is Porter’s health … A lot of times, players who undergo disc-related surgery report additional back problems at some point during their career … Whatever team selects Porter will have to be comfortable with his medical reports … ",6-11,210,SF,Missouri,Fr.,2018

Staying more active and using teammates to run his defender off screens to create open looks … Has a narrow shot base on his jumper, which makes it easier for him to find himself off balance on jump shots … Has a tendency to settle for jump shots instead of probing the defense … Focuses on scoring and as a result will sometimes force his offense or miss passing to an open teammate … Needs to improve his court vision, especially in drive and kick opportunities … Needs to ensure that he plays hard all the time, sometimes appears to be trying to conserve energy for the offensive end … Not an efficient scorer, projects more as a volume scorer … Should get to the free throw line more than he does, but will need to improve his free throw percentage to feel comfortable going to the charity stripe often … ",6-5,195,SG,Miami,Fr.,2018

Kevin Huerter,": Huerter is a smart, skilled playmaker that offers a nice versatile package that NBA teams look for in today’s game … Huerter’s biggest selling point is his ability to shoot the ball from the perimeter and space the floor … In his sophomore season at Maryland he shot 42 percent from past the arc, up from a solid 37 percent in his freshman season … He has become a terrific catch and shoot player from both a stationary position and coming off of screens … He has great shot preparation, gets excellent rotation on the ball and has deep range … This past season he also showed capability to put the ball on the floor and knock down shots in the mid-range area … This was a big reason his field goal percentage increased a full eight points from last season … Huerter has good size for the shooting guard position at 6’6 and a nice frame that should fill out with time … He is also a fairly good athlete who moves fluidly and has good leaping ability … Huerter is an intelligent player and plays the game unselfishly … He does a great job moving the ball and finding the open man to keep the offense flowing … He has become a pretty good facilitator, averaging 3.4 assists per game this past season … Huerter also does a nice job on the glass for a guard, as he averaged five rebounds per game in two seasons at Maryland … He is not the most physically gifted player in the world, but he is a decent defensive player and does a good job using his size to his advantage … He plays very hard on this end of the court and does a nice job of sliding his feet to stay in front of his man … ",": Huerter does not have great length, measuring at just a 6’7 wingspan, which will limit his upside defensively … He has a solid frame but still needs to add strength before he can handle NBA level physicality … He is not a great finisher at the rim (though he’ll surprise at times) and with his current lack of length and strength, he may have a difficult time getting to the basket at the next level … He can be somewhat one-dimensional offensively, as he is not a great ball-handler and does not get to the free-throw line very often … Huerter struggles when he has to put the ball on the deck for more than a couple of dribbles and can be a bit turnover prone when forced to do this … He is mostly a catch and shoot guy at this stage and does not have a very explosive first step to get by his man … Because of that combined with his lack of length, he will likely struggle against longer and more athletic players on both ends of the court in the NBA …  ",6-7,195,SG,Maryland,So.,2018
Grayson Allen,": Competitive, sometimes overly so shoorting guard with a pure shooting stroke and solid ability to attack the rim … Underrated athlete with a 40.5 inch vertical (measured at Combine) … Was Duke’s big late game hero in their last NCAA title three years ago … What can’t be taken away from Allen is his career production and his willingness to sacrifice for his team … As a player, Allen is a streaky guy who can score points in chunks from the perimeter when he’s dialed in … At his best he is a knockdown shooter from distance, capable of catching fire. especially if he’s not accounted for … Looks to maneuver around hard closeouts … He has the ability to put the ball on the floor and create some offense, and is pretty good at scoring on the move without the ball too … Solid leaper who is capable of playing above the rim in space, and with adequate body control … Has some good natural ability, and when focused he can shoot well whether stationary or off a screen or curl, and is relatively comfortable creating for himself and his teammates … Pretty decent pick and roll player with a willingness to feed bigs on their way to the rim … Not a selfish player, will put his body on the line on both ends, and is pretty adept at taking charges … Generally puts in good effort on the court, improved his activity level with each passing season … Had to embrace a “villain” persona, assumed a leadership role on a young team in his last season, and there is something to be said about how he adjusted his mindset and role playing with basically a new cast of players in each of his seasons at Duke … A 80+% FT shooter throughout college career … ",": Will turn 23 in October making him one of the older prospects being considered for this year’s draft … A bit undersized for a SG at 6′ 4"" with a 6′ 7"" wingspan and a 8′ 1"" standing reach, so he has prototype size for a SG that also has experience playing point … His style of attacking the basket and then flailing his arms after meeting contact will not work as well at the next level … Over the course of his career, Allen often proved to be an undisciplined and erratic player … his tripping incidents were a little blown out of proportion by media, however he didn’t make himself any fans with his behavior … Is the type of player that doesn’t seem to always have a short memory, and will compound a bad shooting performance by letting it effect the rest of his game … Sometimes his decision making is questionable … Will take unnecessary risks when looking to create, and has a habit of jumping in the air with nowhere to go as a passer and when finishing at the rim, leading to bad possessions … Does not handle length and athleticism that well, can be smothered when hedged by athletic bigs and struggle to contain dribble penetration when matched up with quicker, more athletic players … Ordinary handles, does not show much creativity with the ball and will not strike fear in the hearts of NBA teams in an isolation set … Has some rigidness to him, tends to play too upright when handling the ball which limits his quickness attacking defenders…Only shot 45% or above from the floor in 1 season in his career (2015-2016), which is concerning …Well-documented history of dirty plays and meltdowns during games, which very likely has been dissected by NBA teams that have interviewed him … His effort is to be commended, but the fact that Duke had to switch to a zone defense to mask the team’s defensive lapses is alarming … Has experience playing as a lead guard, but it is tough to see that translating to the next level considering some of the holes in his game …Was not as effective a player with teammate and projected lottery pick Marvin Bagley in the lineup this past season …  ",6-4,200,SG,Duke,Sr.,2018

Jaxson Hayes,": Blessed with tremendous size and length, Jaxson Hayes’ physical tools are probably some of the most obvious traits that jump off the page when projecting him for the next level … Standing 6’11” and sporting a 7’4” wingspan with massive hands and a frame that should easily be able to build from his current 220 pound weight … Hayes also pairs this with fluid athleticism and end to end speed … At Texas this length and athleticism allowed him to protect the rim at an elite level … While only playing 23.3 minutes per contest, Jaxson blocked 2.2 shots per game (3.77 per 40 minutes) and altered a significant amount of potential shots, something that doesn’t show up in the stat column … These physical traits should translate to the next level and make him a legit NBA rim protector … Hayes’ mobility also allows him to hedge well during pick and roll defense, and not be limited to a lane clogger on the defensive end …  His defense is probably his calling card at this point in his development, but Hayes has offensive appeal as a rim runner/lob target as well as a player with a track record of finishing around the rim … According to hoop-math.com, Hayes shot 86.7% on his shots around at the rim and 72.7% of his shots overall … His massive hands also make him a high level lob target who can grab just about everything in his vicinity … He’s also a pretty solid offensive rebounder (1.8 orpg) and can be respectable collecting misses … He certainly plays within his limits on offense, but a surprising 74% FT percentage and solid mechanics on his shot gives him some upside in the face up game … Jaxson is also the son of an NFL tight end, and knows what kind of dedication it takes to be a professional athlete, which also bodes well for his development as a player …  ",": While Hayes possesses a great frame, he’ll need to continue to not only add muscle to ready himself for the next level, but also work on his toughness … While flying though the air, and catching lobs using his finesse, he’s quite comfortable, but more physical players got under his skin and he often faded in effectiveness when being bodied up on both offense and defense … Gaining that edge may mean the difference of him being a serviceable NBA defender to one who excels … Like many young big men, Hayes is also foul prone … The game is still a little fast for him, and hopefully as he develops he’ll be able to cut back on ticky tack fouls … He’s not a particularly good passer either, and only tallied 9 assists all season for the Longhorns … Because he’s likely far away both skill and body wise from being a NBA contributor, a team is taking the risk that he doesn’t produce much offensively before his first contract is up … ",6-11,220,PF/C,Texas,Fr.,2019

Gonzaga often uses him to spearhead their press and he never appears winded or runs out of energy late in games … Naturally athletic frame with good muscle tone …  ",": Needs to continue to improve his 1-on-1 skills and ability to create off the dribble, in order to enhance his shooting and scoring ability … Must continue to polish his feel for the game … Has a good wingspan, but at 6-8 is a bit small at the power forward position … Not a perfect fit at either forward position, though he could work at the next level as a match up, small ball four if he continues to get stronger and expands his shooting range … Doesn’t possess the fastest first step to get by smaller defenders … Must become a better passer and ball handler and add the ability to create pull up jumpers in rhythm … Being late to the game, (playing against high level competition) there are times that he looks a little lost when plays break down. He has moments where he makes shots that look unorthodox or shots that are off by a lot. His lack of feel at times is due to coming to the game late … At times will challenge bigger players and go into the teeth of the defense and force up contested low percentage shots, or get his shot blocked  … Only 7% of his shots were from three point range, though he did hit a very solid clip at 45% … Should look to expand his shooting range (to NBA 3) and make the three point shot a bigger part of his arsenal … Not the most physical of players at the 4 position. Could improve on his rebounding at 6.5 rebound per game … Struggles at times to keep a handle on the ball, allowing it to get poked loose. Should look to strengthen his hands and wrists with weights … Struggles some to limit opponents scoring.

He’s great at coming off screens and floating the corners to get open shots … Windler needs very little time to catch and setup for his shot, and his left handed release can sometimes catch defenders off guard … Playing in a fast paced Belmont offense many of his 3’s this season came in transition which will aid in his translation to the NBA landscape … Additionally, at 6’7.5” in shoes and sporting an 8’8.5” standing reach, he’s plenty tall  to get his shot off in the league … Windler is also an aggressive player, who not only hunts for his shot, but hustles for rebounds, and takes advantages of cutting opportunities to get shots at the rim … His 10.8 rebounds per game is a very good level for a player who spends so much time around the perimeter, and his 1.9 offensive rebounds per contest lead to 23 second chance buckets … Another plus regarding his rebounding is that he’s really good at pushing the pace after collecting a miss on the defensive end … As rebounding is one of the most translatable skills to the NBA, while Windler is not elite in terms of positional size and athletic ability, he measures out pretty well and project to at least be solid on the glass … With a 6’10” wingspan, a 2.94 second shuttle and a 37.5” max vertical, Dylan tested really well when compared to his peers … He’s not really a slasher, but  works off cuts well, and often finishes above the rim … He shot a very good 74.5% at the rim last season(hoop-math.com) and converts free throws at an 84.7% clip … A low mistake player, who only averaged 2.1 TO’s per game despite being a focal point in Belmont’s offense … Very methodical, Dylan uses spacing well, and will likely benefit from the deeper NBA three point line … ",":  Despite being surprisingly quick and athletic, Dylan really needs to work on his strength to make the leap to the next level … At 195 pounds, he’ll likely be effected by stronger players at his position, and will struggle to match up defensively … He wasn’t much of a shot blocker in college, and will likely not be a factor in contesting shots … Windler will also turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he has a mature game while being pretty close to his prime … His ceiling doesn’t project to be that much higher than where he is now …  One on one perimeter scoring will be more difficult in the NBA, and he will likely have to rely more on running off screens, while a good ball handler, he’s not exactly a break you down or blow past you type of presence on the wing … ",6-7,195,SG/SF,Belmont,Sr.,2019

James Wiseman,": Wiseman has physical tools that really stand out on the court, standing 7 feet with a long (7-foot-6 wingspan) and rangy frame … Considering his elite size, it is very intriguing that he brings nimble feet, agility, solid leaping ability and long strides making him an extremely promising big man on both ends of the floor … Has potential as a paint “patroller” on defense, and you have to be mindful of his location when heading to the basket or risk a weakside rejection … Has the size, range, and length to be mentioned along the lines of the top young shot-blockers in the NBA … A southpaw, he is at his best, the closer he is to the rim at the moment, and will be able to get his fair share of easy scores by running like a deer in transition for easy baskets, given the speed and athleticism advantage he will enjoy in most matchups … Looks to play above the rim, and seems like a potentially dynamic finisher as a pick/screen and roll player with his soft hands … While his time at Memphis was limited to 69 total minutes of action, teams shot only 33% when Wiseman was on the court, and he made a good amount of eye opening plays altering and blocking shots … Given his length and athletic ability, it seems likely that his defensive ability will translate to the NBA’s “defensive 3 seconds” rule, as he should be able to switch and defend more than adequately outside the paint and on switches as he gets more experience … Pretty good on the glass, especially as an offensive rebounder, and shows a quick 2nd jump … Shows a soft touch around the rim, as well as a developing turnaround jumper and decent jump hook over his right shoulder as the base of his post moves arsenal … The foundation is there for him to make some hay as a mid range shooter, he just needs more repetition, muscle memory and fundamental consistency … Has the frame to carry at least 15 more lbs of muscle without the loss of mobility … ",": The obvious elephant in the room is that he goes into this draft having played so few minutes of college hoops compared to other 2020 prospects, which makes him a relative unknown in just where he is in his development … While he looked incredibly strong in his first few games, the suspension followed by the decision to shut it down leaves scouts and NBA decision makers with a lot less to work with and the question of just how much his game may have tapered off had he played the entire season … He had a reputation in high school of having a motor that ran hot and cold and there were some questions that many wanted to see answered with a full season of intense play … Wiseman showed glimpses in limited action, but he also showed that he is pretty raw in his skill set and overall basketball IQ at the moment … While he is a potentially game-changing defender, he also seems to be a bit jumpy looking to send shots into the stands, and prone to fakes that lead to fouls or compromises the team’s defensive balance on the court … Whether he can be a true weapon as a scorer at the next level remains in question … He did show decent touch at times with fadaways and mid-range jumpshots … But he remains a real question mark whether he’s a guy that can create legitimate offense for himself  … He’s not very strong or physical right now, will need to put on more weight and get his lower body strength up to bang in the post with the big boys in the NBA … Shot selection can stand to improve, he seems to settle for fade-away shots and jumpers more than you expect for a guy with his physical and athletic traits … His feel for the game seems decent considering his age and development stage, but at times he does appear rushed and mechanical in the low post getting into his moves, and he needs to work on developing his back to the basket game … His ability to defend out on the perimeter is potentially very good for a big guy, but he has some things to learn fundamentally to realize it (ie playing less upright and not relying solely on his length to make up for being out of position) … Doesn’t seem to project to be an elite level shot creator in the post, which means the situation he lands in will matter that much more to his individual success because others will have to create for him, and teach him the nuances of the offensive game … ",7-1,235,C,Memphis,Fr.,2020

Similar to Lonzo Ball struggles to create in ISO situations as his jumpshot is easily blocked due to a long, unorthodox shooting motion … Will have to prove he can make shots from NBA 3 point range, despite his good percentages in college … Can struggle with physical guards, sometimes can be pestered into turnovers … Not necessarily a natural scorer despite considerable uptick in his scoring in the past year, doesn’t have a bag of tricks to create for himself if he can’t beat you with his quickness at the moment … Though his numbers have improved and he’s the best prospect on Iowa State, his team has struggled this season more than you’d typically associate with a player discussed as a potential high 1st round pick …Though quick and shifty, doesnt possess explosive leaping ability and is mostly a below the rim player … ",6-5,185,PG,Iowa St.,So.,2020

Furkan Aldemir,": Another big man from the Turkish camp … Aldemir is a center with good size and adequate athletic skills … His footspeed and the coordination of his upperbody make him a very interesting player, ready to play in the NBA … His main attribute is the propensity to grab rebounds: he has strong instincts for this part of the game … On offense he lacks a polished one-on-one game, but understands all situations and is always ready for passes … Another important skill for a big man is his efficiency in free throws, and we can consider him reliable (75% in Euroleague, 51% in Turkish League).

Kris Joseph,": Excellent frame and length for the small forward position- measured in with a 6’11 wingspan and 8’7.5 standing reach at the pre-draft combine. Looks the part of an NBA swingman, with well above average physical tools and agility. He bulked up significantly during his four years at Syracuse without adding much extra weight. Primary scoring option on a balanced elite eight team during his senior season (13.4 PPG).  At his best in the slashing game where he can gather momentum without the dribble. Improved strength, body control and right/left hand aptitude allows him to complete plays around the rim. Dramatically improved in the mid-range game knocking down pull jumpers after a few power dribbles. Needs to get his legs underneath the shot and go straight up- not efficient when forced to drift horizontally. Solid base, good elevation. 35% three-point shooter, most of the standstill variety. Accuracy from deep is night and day from two short years ago (22%). Confident dribble/driver with dominant right hand. Long strider. Smooth repertoire with just enough herky jerky to keep opponents off balance. For better or worse, does not step out of his comfort zone on the court. Committed under a turnover per game last season. Length wreaked havoc in 2-3 zone, consistently getting deflections and jumping passing lanes (1.4 SPG). Projects as a versatile defender possessing size, athleticism and lateral quickness. ",": Despite leading Syracuse in scoring, Joseph rarely showed the willingness, or the skill set, to dominate. Vibe of passivity, satisfied to be another piece in the puzzle. His shot creation with the rock in his hands is limited. 38% of his field goal attempts came from distance, which is hard to fathom given his physical canvas. As a result, his FG efficiency dropped to 42% when asked to carry more of the offensive load. Too many settles. While his ball handling has developed, he stills maintains a high dribble with an extreme favoritism to his right side. When he starts left he either pulls up or spins back right. Picks up his dribble at the first sight of congestion. Off the dribble moves are highly predictable. He seems to tighten up rather than be free-flowing with his movements, serving as a detriment to his first step. Lost some explosion in quickness and leaping departments with added bulk—stiffness. Deliberate jumpshot mechanics. Does not have wrist strength to convert off balance opportunities. Projecting his defense at the next level is exactly that; projection. He sat in a zone for nearly four full seasons, albeit, that zone did have man principles. Never quite fulfilled the promise he displayed during an eye catching sophomore campaign. At 23 years of age he’s old for his draft class placing real boundaries on further growth in his skills.   Adam Ganeles 6/20/12 Strengths: Kris seems to be a quintessential swingman small forward … He’s a great athlete, with tremendous leaping abilities … He is always active, always trying to make something happen around the basket whether its getting tips or put backs …  He’s an above average rebounder mainly due to his explosiveness, high energy and constant motor- always following shots and trying to make something happen around the basket … His long wingspan and athleticism give him potential to be good defender … Offensively he’s always looking for the open space … His short range game is good, not great, although seems to be improving with each game … Tends to shoot better off one dribble as opposed to catch and shoot … Has an explosive first step making for one or two strong takes to the rim per game when a lane is available …    ",6-7,215,SF,Syracuse,Sr.,2012

JaMychal Green,": Undersized 4-man with standout mobility and athleticism. 7’2.25 wingspan covers up shortcomings in the height department. Displayed excellent lateral movement in the Lane Agility Drill at the pre-draft combine (10.63, 4th). Explosive finisher with quick, decisive moves in the post. Plays with power and attitude around the rim, when he spots the rim he won’t be denied. Posterized many an SEC defender. Works hard early to establish deep post position- demands the rock. High percentage mid-teens scorer (55% senior, 52% career). Kept up his FG% despite slowly advancing his perimeter game and mid-range jumper. Solid jumpshot mechanics, capable of converting in both face up and catch and shoot situations. Legitimate pick and roll target. Not overly “ripped”, but possesses tremendous strength and wide shoulders- 19 reps of 185 lbs (2nd behind Jae Crowder). Quick off the floor for offensive boards (3 per game). With his combination of lower body strength and length he can be a terror on the glass when bringing his A effort (7.5 TRPG). Talented shot blocker averaging between 1.5 and 2 blocks all four seasons. Green was the centerpiece of an offensively limited roster for much of his career, forced to face collapsing defenses and consistent doubles. Passing instincts have improved substantially (1.8 APG). Boosted his stock at the PIT scoring 13 points and grabbing 8 boards per. ",": Heavily reliant on strength/brute force in college, an advantage he won’t maintain against NBA power forwards. Displays the agility to thrive as a face up 4, now needs to cultivate the skills. Mid-range jumper has come a long way, but remains inconsistent. Has a tendency to fade unnecessarily. Must work on ball-handling as multiple dribbles are not within his comfort zone. Exploiting less mobile 4’s off the bounce should be a major facet of his game. At this stage his athleticism hasn’t translated onto the perimeter. In an isolation focused offense at Alabama didn’t get many opportunities to move without the ball- pick and roll game should suit his skill package well. Being undersized, effort on the defensive boards must be relentless… an area that has come under scrutiny. Turnover figure (2.8) way too high for a predominantly post player. Footwork and overall post repertoire are a work in progress. Green was hit with a four game suspension in February for conduct detrimental to the team- further specifics were never disclosed. Note: Averaged 13 points and 6 rebounds per game at the World University Games last summer.  Adam Ganeles 6/24/12 Strengths: Rapidly ascending power forward with excellent fluidity and athleticism … Shows a lot of upside due to his length, explosiveness and aggressiveness … Threw down numerous highlight dunks, in particular put backs in his freshman year …Very aggressive attacking the basket in the post and flushes some monster two handed dunks if he gets an angle to the basket … Has good ability to make adjustments at the rim and shows a solid understanding of playing in the post … Quick leaping ability, reflexes, body control, and excellent hands allows him to convert a lot of plays around the basket … Excellent rebounder. Crashes the glass hard and gets a lot of follow up dunks and tip ins on the offensive boards. Gathered nearly as many offensive rebounds as defensive last season (110O to 132D) … A solid defender with good foot speed and shot blocking ability (1.6 bpg) … Good leg strength which should only improve along with his body … Has a big wingspan (in the neighborhood of 7-foot-1) which adds to his athleticism … Shows solid form on his shot, giving intrigue about his offensive potential … Very fluid running the floor and converts fast break plays with ease. A strong finisher … Displays excellent hands, catching the ball from teammates and corralling boards … Has some developing post moves with the use of drop steps and jump hooks … Most effective on the left block going back to the basket to his right … His ineffectiveness facing the basket is a weakness but also a strength as he puts more emphasis on being a post player …  ",6-9,217,PF,Alabama,Sr.,2012
Tomas Satoransky,": Certainly one of the most complete guards of the young generation in Europe … Born in 1991and appears ready for the 2012 NBA Draft after two years in Liga ACB (Spanish League) … Tomas is a point guard with great size, excellent vision and ability to pass the ball … Physically strong, allowing him to easily finish near the rim … He is a good spot-up shooter, with range out to the three point line … Shooting is not his first offensive option, but in the last Eurocup season he averaged 43% from the distance … He’s a smooth player with a quick first step and a strong ability to finish in traffic … He also possesses standout athletic ability by European standards (he’s a spectacular dunker!) … He has a winning spirit, and always competes hard … He is also a good defensive player because of his desire, athleticism and the versatility to defend multiple positions … ",": One-on-one game needs improvement for the NBA … Lacks an in-between game, his shot off the dribble is not very solid … In general he’s not very good to create own shot … Despite his strong body is not a good rebounder … Plays the PG position but may need to transition over the the 2 position for the NBA … Needs to become a little more assertive, (vocal leadership) particularly if he wants to play PG …  ",6-7,201,PG/SG,Czech Republic,Intl.,2012
William Buford,": Buford is a nicely sized 6’5 SG who is coming off a very nice college career for Ohio State…Buford looks like a standard NBA SG physically, having both respectable strength and length (6’9 wingspan)…Buford is also a solid athlete, who shows decent explosiveness and leaping skills as well as speed and quickness…Offensively, Buford makes hay with his jump shot…Is a very effective mid-range shooter, where his pull-up elbow shot is his favorite move to utilize…He has NBA range on his shot and a very nice stroke with his jumper…Shooting fundamentals are very consistent and prototypical, good form, release speed and nice elevation…Was a pretty good shooter throughout his career, being a threat to make shots off screens and with his feet set from 3…Very consistent spot-up shooter when left open…Generally is an unselfish player, and isn’t a bad passer…Plays a very smooth, controlled game and rarely ever appears to be in a rush to make things happen…Has no problems playing within the offense, and doesn’t need to dominate the ball to be effective…Doesn’t look bad playing in transition, being a threat to trail for jumpers or make basic finishes at the rim in the open floor…Generally shows a high IQ, doesn’t really makes a lot of mistakes and keeps things basic…A willing defender…Pretty solid rebounder for a wing…Good FT shooter…A winner and durable player who was a 4-year starter for some very good Ohio State teams ",": Buford doesn’t have any truly elite characteristics…His best attribute is his jump shot, but he has gone through shooting slumps and saw his shooting percentages drop across the board as a Sr. after being a 44% shooter from deep as a Jr…Buford’s being weakness right now is his ball-handling skills…He rarely ever makes it to the rim in half-court situations…He’s a pretty average athlete by NBA standards, and it really is concerning if you consider that the ball slows him down even more when he looks to operate off the dribble…Not much of a factor as an isolation player…Struggles against more athletic matchups offensively, who can crowd him without worrying about him beating them off the dribble often…Not the best finisher around the rim when amongst the trees…Although adequate as a defender, he doesn’t stand out and can have some trouble against quicker slashers…Kind of conservative, not really the type who will do extra things, which is good at times but also makes him pretty predictable…Gets to the foul line at a below average level, further showing his lack of comfort attacking off the dribble ",6-5,215,SG,Ohio St.,Sr.,2012
Josep Franch,": Good height for the position, he’s an underrated athlete … Great leadership and basketball IQ. He has good playmaking skills and natural instincts as a passer … Pushes the ball in transition effectively and attacks the basket with confidence, often finding teammates when the defense collapses on him … Strong defensive work ethic, with good instincts and quick hands. He’s a master of  intangibles … Often has a great influence on games without remarkable stats … Great experience despite young age … ",": Though crafty, his athleticism is below average by NBA standards… He could suffer defensively due to his lack of lateral quickness … Poor perimeter shooter that limits his offensive effectiveness … His mid-range game is lacking … Needs to bulk up … ",6-3,190,PG,Spain,Intl.,2012
Scott Machado,": A pure, pass-first point guard, Machado’s best attribute is his incredible floor vision both in the half court and transition … The game just slows down for Machado, whose excellent anticipation as a passer meshes with his roving peripheral vision … Works the drive and dish game effectively, hitting his shooters in rhythm on the perimeter and cutters in stride through the lane … Good athlete, not great, with a quick first step and a nice burst off the dribble hesitation and over screens … Shows nice touch on finesse shots over the interior line of defense …  Improved his 3pt percentage to 40% as a senior, showing fluent mechanics and a sense of comfort shooting both off the dribble and the catch … Excellent control and decision-making running the break … Shows a strong ability to protect the ball (3-1 a/to ratio) …  ",": Machado is not an overwhelming athlete or speed merchant, which is generally required for most 6’1 average sized point guards … Lacks explosion, which will make finishing around the rim a challenge at the next level … Won’t get you a ton of points as a scorer (only scored over 20 once all season) … He’s vulnerable defending in isolation, which will be an issue against stronger and quicker NBA point guards … Playing in the MAAC, he doesn’t face the level of competition of say a Kendall Marshall or Marquis Teague, which could strike fear in the minds of scouts who will be comparing and evaluating…  ",6-2,205,PG,Iona,Sr.,2012
Reggie Bullock,": At 6’7, 207 pounds, Bullock has good size and length for the NBA SG position … Showed vast improvement in each season at UNC shooting the ball and was one of the ACC’s top 3 shooters this year … Took on much more of a leadership role at UNC his junior year and was easily Carolina’s most consistent performer … Shot almost 44% from deep on 5.8 attempts per game (over half of his overall field goal attempts a game) … Has a text book shooting stroke and a quick release … Moves well without the ball and shoots it very well running off of screens or spotting up for open looks … Bullock is a very smart player that plays to his strengths and ""stays within himself"" … Prudent ball protector. Only averaged 1.2 turnovers a game while playing the most minutes for the Heels at 31.4 per game … A great rebounder for his size (6.5 per game), especially evident when UNC switched to their smaller line up late in the season … Has a nice Euro step move when going into the lane … Could turn out to be the perfect scoring role player for a team in the NBA …  ",": Plays a finesse game and could stand to get a lot tougher … Bullock does not possess great 1-on-1 skills due to his lack of ball handling ability and ability to drive by opponents … Will need facilitators on the floor to set him up as his ability to create shots is virtually nonexistant … Despite being highly recruited and seen as an elite athlete in high school, did not show it while at UNC … Rarely even tried to dunk the basketball and sometimes would miss close range shots because he did not go up strong with the ball .. Did not take the offensive strides many expected in his new role his junior year. Decent at finishing around the rim but definitely needs to develop a better floater/tear drop game to succeed at the next level … Not an aggressive enough player going to the rim, evidenced by him only averaging 2.1 free throw attempts per game … Needs to improve his ball handling if he ever wants to be an NBA shooting guard and strength if he wants to be a starting forward … Considering his size and athleticism, Bullock should be a much better defender. He doesn’t seem to put the same emphasis on it and his focus and intensity are not great … Doesn;t seem to like to get his hands dirty and get physical on the defensive end and his numbers show that he’s a below average on ball and overall defender … Leaves you wanting more, and wondering if he had more competitiveness and toughness how much better he could be …  ",6-7,200,SG/SF,North Carolina,Jr.,2013
Livio Jean-Charles,": Livio is a very long (7’2 wingspan) and fluid athlete who plays with high intensity and energy … Excels in the role of garbage man, slashing to the basket and scoring on put backs … Very agile player showing excellent speed in the open floor … A strong defender doing an excellent job of crowding opponents using his great length, reflexes and quick feet … A scorer more than a shooter, but shows the ability to knock down mid-range jumpers with solid form … Crafty around the basket and shows the ability to face up and get by his man and to the rim … Good attitude. Hard working kid who shows the desire to improve … Fits the role well of an energy role player, providing a spark with effort, defense and some scoring, without needing plays called for him … ",": A tweener for the NBA. Has the size/length to play the PF position, but is more of a finesse guy who plays well in space instead of banging in the paint … Lacks upper body strength to be able to withstand contact against NBA bigs … Should improve upon post game .. Narrow shoulders, thin bone structure, and therefore doesn’t appear to be the type that can add much upper body muscle mass. Will likely peak at 225-230 lbs … Needs to add more range and consistency to his shot … Not an incredibly explosive athlete, but solid and is very fluid and quick … ",6-9,217,SF/PF,France,Intl.,2013
Jeff Withey,": Legit 7-footer with excellent size for the NBA center position … Has become one of the dominant bigmen and a consistent performer and scorer on the college level … Showed solid improvement from his junior to senior season raising his scoring average to 13.8 per game along with 8.5 rebounds and 3.9 blocks, while anchoring the defense for one of the top teams in the nation … Also raised his shooting numbers from the field from 54% to 58% … A strong defensive presence. Shows an aptitude for blocking shots with good timing, and quick reflexes to swat shots. Set the all time tournament record for blocked shots in 2012 … Has developed some solid post moves and shows the ability to score in the paint … Solid free throw shooter hitting 80% as a junior and 71.5% as a senior. … Has solid though unspectacular length with a reported 7’1.5 wingspan … ",": He is a year older than the graduating senior class (23) so even though he’s shown improvement in his game this year, his upside is questionable … Took a few years out of high school before becoming an effective college player … Bigmen often take longer to develop but detractors will question why it took him so long to break through. (In fairness, he had to wait his turn behind Cole Aldrich and the Morris Twins) … Some view him as an older player beating up on players 2-3 years younger (on average) than himself … Scouts aren’t sold on his offensive abilities and question how effective he will be offensively at the next level … Lack of lateral quickness makes him a liability in pick and roll situations … Not great in the open floor. More effective playing in the half court. Appears very rigid, lower body awkward and uncoordinated … Has decent speed in the open floor, but some wonder if the big, slower center is a dinosaur in today’s NBA. Does Withey have the foot speed and athleticism to be as effective in the NBA as he is in college … Likely would have been a much better fit in 1990, than today’s NBA … Upperbody strength is average by NBA standards … ",7-0,222,C,Kansas,Sr.,2013
Ricardo Ledo,": Great size for a shooting guard to go along with top notch scoring instincts … Very advanced handle used to create separation … Able to create his own shot from a variety of places on the court, adept at changing speeds … Has a great ability to see the floor, willing passer … Played PG many times throughout his prep career, can be relied upon as primary ball handler at times … Potential to guard multiple positions as well as fill multiple positions in an offensive set … Can stretch the floor, has a high release on his shot … Quick hands that give him an advantage on both sides of the court … Finishes well with either hand, hard to force into a weak spot … Can move quite well laterally, has definite potential to be a solid wing defender … High basketball IQ, seems to have a natural ability and sense of where to best operate on the floor … Deceptive athlete if not an explosive one, which is really what makes his offensive skill set something to constantly taken into account as an opposing defender … Wild card prospect with a lot of upside … ",": Used to playing with the ball in his hands, playing off the ball may be quite an adjustment … Lacks optimal upper body strength at this point and can have trouble with contact … Inconsistent shooting mechanics, as well as sometimes being plagued by poor shot selection … Character concerns since he was in high school, had to sit out his entire freshman season at Providence due to academic issues only to enter the draft … Lack of experience against top notch college competition, major unknown as to how he reacts against higher competition … Questions about the level of effort, energy as to whether Ledo brings this on a consistent basis … Very used to being the top option, some wonder whether he will adhere to playing a role and finding a niche at a pro level or whether he has the ability to adhere to a team setting … Conditioning needs some work, was out of high level basketball for a year and he will more than likely take time to adjust to the NBA game speed ",6-6,197,SG,Providence,Fr.,2013
Glen Rice Jr.,": Talented & aggressive wing … Good ISO game. Plays better with the ball in his hands … Runs the floor well providing great spacing and making highlight plays … A strong leaper, particularly off of two feet … Huge wingspan. Appears to have in the neighborhood of a 6-10 wingspan, giving him good length to finish plays … Brings energy to a team with his dynamic plays in traffic … Will get to the rim and finish strong with contact, uses his long arms and leaping ability to get in the lane and crash the glass, an excellent rebounder at his size. Has shown the ability to get up and block shots off the vertical jump and from the weak side. His athleticism is well suited to the half court … Can shoot the NBA 3 and beyond and has made big shots late in the shot clock … Similar to his Dad, Glen Rice Sr., a very good spot up shooter and consistently knocks down the NBA corner 3 in catch and shoot situations … Has made a real case for himself as an NBA player with a strong season, and even better post season playing in the D-League … ",": Also similar to Rice Sr., he doesn’t explode very well off of one foot, limiting his effectiveness in transition to a degree … Needs to work on finishing plays with his off-hand … BBIQ is questionable, needs to make better decisions with the ball when facing a trapping situation … Lacks great blow by speed off the dribble, and overall speed is just average … Passing ability needs more work when executing drive and kick … Poor P&R ball handler & poor shot selection, which is one of his biggest weaknesses … A very streaky shooter, and not physical or strong enough to defend in the post, needs to work on lateral foot speed, fundamentals in sliding his feet on defense … Gets caught standing too upright at times on defense when playing off the ball … Should look to be more aggressive when defending on the ball, bringing more fire & intensity to force turnovers … There are some real concerns about his character/maturity after being kicked off Georgia Tech team for disciplinary reasons. The final straw was an incident in a nightclub. In the aftermath, he was charged with ""permitting unlawful operation"" as a passenger in his own vehicle, and a friend was charged with a DUI. Another passenger was charged with discharging a firearm while under the influence in the club … Leading up to his dismissal, he had ""numerous disciplinary issues"" while at Georgia Tech … ",6-6,211,SG,USA,Jr.,2013
James Ennis,": High flying athlete with good size/length for the wing position … Spectacular dunker. Strong, explosive legs and very aggressive attacking the basket … A terror in the open floor due to his above average run/jump athleticism. Ennis gets out for a lot of breakaway dunks using anticipation and long arms to jump passing lanes … Shows solid touch and good shooting ability … Displays a textbook shooting motion and the ability to set his feet quickly and get a shot off in rhythm … Possesses great size and athleticism to play the 3 position … Good shot selection, using pump fakes well to get opponents off the floor and set up shots … Shows the ability to pull up off the dribble as well as spot up and knock down shots in catch and shoot situations … Skill level has steadily progressed through hard work … Solid three point shot, knocking down 36% from distance on a high volume of shots (5 per game) … A quality ball handler, showing comfortability going through his legs, though more effective in catch and shoot than creating shots off of ISOs … Plays with good energy. Hustles … Led the 49ers in both scoring (16.5) and rebounding (6.7) … Despite low a/to numbers, shows good vision and passing skills … Plays with good energy, slahing to the basket for rebounds … Comes from a strong family, willing to work hard … Mature player with 4 years of college under his belt … Despite being a senior, shows good potential left to develop … Measured with a 6’11 1/2 wingspan at the Portsmouth Invitation Tournament … ",": A ""momentum athlete"". Lack of a quick first step to blow by opponents makes him less of a threat in ISO situations … At times gets sloppy and forces passes, 3.0 turnovers per game were too many although he had the ball in his hands a lot … Lacks experience at a high level. Played just two years at Long Beach State after transferring from Ventura Junior College. Level of competition is not top shelf playing in the Big West Conference … Will turn 23 a few days after the draft making him a little old for a senior … Not a physical player, and can be pushed around in the paint due to a lack of upper body strength … Should look to tighten up his handles further … Lateral quickness could improve with better fundamentals … ",6-7,200,SG/SF,Long Beach St...,Sr.,2013
CJ Leslie,": Explosive athlete who excites with his above-the-rim play … Has great length (7’1.5”) and uses it to disrupt shots (1.2 BPG) and swipe the ball (1 SPG) on defense … Though he is 21, he still has loads of untapped potential thanks to his athletic ability … One of the best in this draft class at getting to the line, Leslie averaged 6.6 attempts per game last season … Great slasher … Has a solid face-up game and is hard to stop when he gets the ball in the high post … Is a fantastic dunker thanks to his leaping ability … Great finisher on the fast break … Solid ball-handler who should be a matchup problem when guarded by power forwards … Runs the floor very well, making him a good transition player … Is generally considered a small forward but has the length to play the 4 … His dunking prowess can change the momentum of a game and get the crowd behind the team … Shot a solid FG percentage (52%) last season … Is a very good rebounder for a small forward thanks to his length and leaping ability (averaged 7.4 RPG last season) … Surprisingly effective in spot up opportunities, though they were limited … Great hands that serve to make him an ideal alley-oop target and help him get numerous put-backs … Defends the perimeter in ISO situations well using his good foot speed and length to disrupt opponents …   ",": Most of his problems stem from a lack of focus and motivation on the court … Questionable motor on both ends of the floor … Scouts have major reservations about his basketball IQ / attitude / negative body language … Doesn’t have a true position. Lacks strength at the 4 and skills to play the 3 … Lacks great decision making, passing skills to play on the perimeter (1:2 A/TO ratio) … Has been known to disappear in games, although he was a bit more consistent in his final college season … Needs to be more assertive, particularly when matched up against smaller or slower defenders … Offensively his touches come in a variety of ways, but nothing is overly effective … Lacks any sort of consistent perimeter shot, which allows bigger defenders to play off of him … More effective in transition than in the half court game. NC State attempted to use him on the block, but his post game never evolved … Gets lazy on defense and fails to do the little things, such as closing out on shooters and fighting through screens … Too skinny for his size and must put on weight or he will be unable to defend the 4 (his natural position) in the NBA … Turnover-prone (3 per game last season) … No consistent post moves will force him to be a face-up forward … Inability to ad strength via weight training during college career points to a lack of work ethic … Hasn’t come close to his full potential at age 21, which suggests that he never will … Will turn 22 just before draft night, meaning he’s the age of a senior … Should be a much more efficient defender considering his athleticism and length … Really struggles defending in the post …   ",6-9,209,SF/PF,NC State,Jr.,2013
Lorenzo Brown,": Brown is an oversized PG with a highly intriguing physical canvas … More than looks the part. Standing at 6’5, he’s able to scan the defense unfettered, flashing tremendous court vision and a natural creativity (7.2 AST as junior, 6th in NCAA) … Plays at a comfortable pace with the ball in his hands; chews up ground with long strides, but gives off the impression of “gliding” … Takes advantage of his height on the glass- active contributor on the defensive backboard (3.7 DRPG) and instant fast break threat … Dangerous in transition where he’s dynamic with the ball and forces defenses to commit, often resulting in the proper shoot/pass decision … Boasts a 4:1 AST: TO ratio and 1.5 points + assists/possession in open court situations … Deceiving quickness, lulls defenders into a particular speed before changing gears … Hang time and acrobatics are readily apparent around the rim, preferring brush contact to sustain momentum … Floaters, runners and leaners are more his cup of tea than traditional, set jumpers … Shows potential with his back to the basket in a limited sampling … Strong penchant for making plays on the defensive side of the ball (2 SPG). Brown displays huge upside as an on-ball defender, allowing .59 PPP last season when isolated … He crowds ball handlers with his length and lateral quickness forcing them into panic halted dribbles … Also possesses quick hands to reel in the fish … Instinctual anticipation of habit moves/passes … When operating in full flight, he’s a prospect worth salivating over … ",": While Brown can seemingly get to any spot on the court he pleases, finishing plays is another story … He shot 29% on jumpers off the bounce and struggled to score when not driving to his left … In NC State’s limited use of the pick and roll (54 possessions) he turned the ball over nearly 17% of the time (3.5 TO overall) … His feel for the P&R, in terms of quick digestion of information and subsequent decision making, needs vast development … Ironically, his pace of play should suite that style to a tee … His half-court game is marked by indecision and lack of efficiency, missing a go-to move or a comfort play … For all his success breaking down defenders 1 on 1 and in transition, he doesn’t get his team into functional sets … Shot 26% from three-point range as a junior … On all jumpers: shot 28% in spot up opportunities and 26% off the catch-and-shoot. Tendency to drift away from the action when not the focal point of a play; his position is at the point … Takes an inordinate numbers of risks defensively, getting out of position, and collapsing the team defensive scheme …  He avoids straight-on contact and playing in the post, two facets that should be staples … Not an explosive finisher– would be well served to add his strength to his 186 pound frame. The perimeter won’t be where he earns his bread … “Underachiever” was the word of choice in Raleigh.  Adam Ganeles 4/29/13 Strengths: Brown is a physically gifted combo guard at 6’5 190 … Pretty fluid athlete with solid quickness … Relishes his opportunities to handle the ball a lot on offense, and is a very good ball-handler too … The game looks natural for him when has the ball in his hands, he gets around the floor easily and is able to use his fluidity to get where he wants on the court … Good instincts … Pretty shifty … Is a developing scorer, but has some natural ability to put the ball in the hoop from 20 ft on in with effectiveness … Not a bad spot-up shooter, with range out to about 22 ft … Shows a developing floater … Is a really intriguing passer for a player, and averaged 6.3 apg as a sophomore … Pretty unselfish, and does a good job of knowing when to look for his shot and when to make feeds to teammates … Good pick and roll player … Can play up tempo and is generally a good decision maker when in transition … Was more aggressive as a soph. when driving the line and seeking out contact, even if he’s still developing his strength … Is a very quick handed defender who uses the size and length advantage he has over more PG’s to his advantage, coming up with a good number of blocks and steals for a PG (1.8 spg and 0.5 bpg) … Also is a good rebounder for a perimeter player (4.5 rpg as a Soph) … Will be able to defend both guard spots in the NBA … Really took advantage of being the lead guard last season under a new coaching staff and the loss of Ryan Harrow … Will be depended on to provide 30 mpg next season once again … Brown has very good upside and will only get better as he gains experience and strength … ",6-5,189,PG/SG,NC State,Jr.,2013
Erik Murphy,": Big man that has an excellent ability to stretch the floor and NBA 3 point range … Improved his body a great deal over his time in college … Also improved as a defender and rebounder with the added strength … Shot 45.3% 3PT as a senior, making 2 per game … Made a high percentage of midrange shots and from the free throw stripe … Extremely quick release off the catch-and-shoot … Very proficient at the pick-and-pop, would fill a niche for teams needing an option in that aspect … Lower body strength has also increased, became much more difficult to push off the block and fight for his spot … Developing post game where his shooting touch and height are advantageous … Solid passer, will look for cutters … Had one of the higher offensive efficiency in the SEC and takes good shots … Decent instincts as a shot blocker, will not get off the floor much though has a solid standing reach that can disrupt players near the basket ",": Not fast laterally while also lacking straight line speed by NBA PF standards … Big liability as a rebounder on both ends, even with his added strength during his 4 college seasons … Not long, which further hurts him as a defender/rebounder … Gets very little lift, measured at the bottom of the NBA Draft Combine in no-step vertical … As with most shooters, does not get to the line often enough to really hurt you with his solid FT shooting as a big man … Never was relied upon to play center, the position he is most athletically suited to defend at the NBA level … Goes along with him being very one dimensional and when that dimension is not working, can turn into a major issue … Even with his shooting being very high level, not many players fit his description in the league who have lasted a long period of time … 1990 born so a year old for his grade dropping his potential down a notch … ",6-10,240,PF,Florida,Sr.,2013
James Southerland,": An excellent shooter, Southerland is one of the most accurate players from three-point range in this draft … Plays with good energy and is streaky. When he gets hot, watch out … Excellent shooting form, one of this class’ purest shooters … Good size for a small forward, standing 6’8” with a 7’1” wingspan … Deadly on the catch-and-shoot … An NBA athlete who can play above the rim and finish alley-oops in transition in spectacular fashion … Quick shooting motion helps him get shots off without much space … Plays passing lanes well, as he averaged two steals per 40 minutes last year (would play free safety in Syracuse zone and intercept skip passes … Has developed solid mid-range game in addition to his outside shooting … Good free throw shooter (79%) … Showed good agility at the combine with a time of 10.9 in the positional lane agility test … One of the top players on Syracuse’s Final Four team … ",": Somewhat one dimensional offensive player, as the bulk of his offense consists of jump shots … Has little ability to create his own shot and is hampered when defenders don’t give him the catch-and-shoot and he’s forced to put the ball on the floor … His draft stock could be hurt by his playing in Boeheim’s 2-3 zone, as his individual defensive ability wasn’t discernible in college. Syracuse’s system often leaves players way behind in picking up man defense … Weighs 221, but has a narrow frame: shouldes and hips, and doesn’t appear capable of adding much strength … At 23 years of age, he is one of the older players in this draft class … Not a particularly good rebounder for his size … Positional concerns as he’s too small to succeed as a 4, but his perimeter defense will hurt him in trying to guard NBA 3’s… ",6-8,221,SF/PF,Syracuse,Sr.,2013
Kenny Kadji,": 6-10 with legitimate length and some skill to stretch the floor … Showed a great deal of improvement during his last two years at the college level, particularly during his senior season when he was a major factor in the Hurricanes garnerning a 2 seed in the NCAA Tournament … High release on his shot with range out to the 3 point line, can draw the defense away from the paint … Can put the ball on the floor and get opponents off balance due to the threat of his jump shooting … Shows solid touch near the rim, with fadeaway shots that with his length are very tough to defend … Has deceptive athleticism and bounce for his size … Part of one of the nations better defenses, showed ability as a help defender and timing as a shot blocker … Showed a lot of improvement as a rebounder … Has a more NBA ready body than most draftees, though that may have to do with his age … Did not foul at a very high rate during his two seasons at Miami (FL) … Was able to play PF for a majority of his time at Miami (FL), while many would be relegated to the C position, should help with his adjustment to his likely pro position ",": Already 25 years of age, meaning he has entered his athletic prime and was quite a bit older than the vast majority of comepetition he faced … Hard to believe he will become radically different from the player he already is, which more than likely limits him to being a rotation option at best down the line … While he did display some improvement, his post game was still very limited and he tended to avoid contact … Not a great offensive rebounder and at best average on the defensive glass as well … Rarely used his athleticism to make cuts or plays near the basket … Did not get to the foul line at a high rate, nor did he ever convert at the rate one might expect with his shooting touch … While more developed than most PF prospects in the draft, still has work to do in that area and will likely take some time to be a contributor … Was unable to break the rotation at Florida even while being a highly regarded HS prospect, one has to wonder what took him so long to develop into a college level contributor … His level of intensity can fade as the game wears on, can suffer from loss of concentration ",6-10,242,PF/C,Miami,Sr.,2013

Great speed to get by defenders off the dribble … Tremendous ability to handle the basketball, like it’s on a string … Aggressive attacking defenders and getting into the paint … Low center of gravity gives him ability to start and stop on a dime and change directions quickly … Solid vision and playmaking skills for others … Improved upon a/to ratio in Sr. year, taking it above 2/1 … ",": His most glaring weakness is his lack of size. At 5’10 he’s a defensive liability and will have to work twice as hard to get open looks, and get passes off … Some teams just won’t consider small point guards due to the liabilities associated with having them on the floor … Unlike a player Pierre often gets compared to, Nate Robinson, who is a ball hawk, Jackson doesn’t show the same tenacity or passion on the defensive end of the floor … Will be a target for post ups from bigger point guards … Overall shooting efficiency dropped from junior to senior year. From 46.0% to 42.7% FG and from 40.8 to 35.9 from 3p … lack of size limits his effectiveness finishing, despite his great athleticism.

What was versatility in college translates to lack of a true position in the NBA … Defense is extremely suspect. Lacks flexibility. Stiff body and ankles. Lacks lateral speed … Finding a place for him on defense will be difficult as his lack of quickness and foot speed will make it tough for him to stay in front of NBA SF’s, and his lack of size will make it difficult to guard NBA PF’s … Lack of foot speed will also affect his offensive effectiveness off the dribble … His rebounding rate was somewhat lacking in college, especially compared to other college PF’s … Much of his offense inside the 3pt. line is predicated on overpowering the weaker defenders he was matched up with in college, which will limit his productivity in the NBA … Doesn’t have the quickness to get past most NBA defenders … Underwhelming athleticism … Though his big frame can be advantageous, it can also limit him in some ways… ",6-6,220,SF/PF,Ohio St.,Jr.,2013

Ryan Kelly,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Nick Fazekas Strength: Standing at 6’11, Kelly has a nice shot at being a stretch four in the league … A highly skilled big with great instincts … Loves the game and has a tremendous work ethic … A very accurate shooter (first evidenced on a national stage by winning the McDonald’s All-American Three Point Shootout in 2009) … Shot 42.2% on threes this year on 3.6 attempts per game … Is definitely more of a spot up shooter but has the ability to hit the pull-up jumper off one dribble as well as having a nice mid-range turnaround in the repertoire … Has very good handles for his size and decent vision in the half court … Surprisingly efficient defender according to the numbers. However his lack of strength, and lack of foot speed will hamper his effectiveness at the next level … Excellent passer and decision maker, 1.7 to 1.0 a/to ratio … ",": Broken foot has come at an inopportune time as it will prevent him from being able to workout for teams leading up to the draft … Does not seem to have a frame that will allow him to get much stronger … A better athlete than given credit for but still below average for NBA level … Will struggle guarding more athletic and stronger forwards in the league … Does not have great foot speed/ foot work, especially moving side to side … Almost strictly a half court player. His transition possessions make up less than 10% of his overall possessions. Extremely low … Not a strong finisher at the rim as he is more of a finesse player … Does not like to be physical in the paint and is a poor rebounder on both the offensive and defensive glass … Only shot 45% and 44% from the field in his last two seasons at Duke, a stat that shows that he’s far too perimeter oriented … Will most likely need to find a team that fits his style in order to find his niche in the NBA.

Archie Goodwin,": Shooting guard with elite quickness and athleticism who flashed immense talent in his freshman season, frequently blowing by defenders and converting plays at the rim with dunks … Has excellent body control and shows a strong ability to finish on the move, knifing through the lane and contorting his body to elude defenders … Displayed a nice crossover, as well as a step back, fade away jumper that he utilized on occasion … At his best when he can isolate and get by his man and find an angle to the basket … Huge wingspan and excellent athleticism makes him a strong finisher at the rim … A true boom or bust type of prospect who early in FR season was widely projected as a one and done lottery pick … Excellent handle for a shooting guard and when combined with a quick first step, he becomes a handful for opposing shooting guards to contain off the dribble … Shows the ability to drive right and left and his ball handling ability is one of his most intriguing assets, showing a lot of room for improvement … Has tremendous length with a 6’10 wingspan, essentially allowing him to play an inch or two bigger than his 6’4 size … Shows a solid ability to shoot off the dribble when he can develop a rhythm, as opposed to spotting up or coming off screens. Still better at creating shots than making them … His length and quickness gives him a lot of defensive potential … Does not suffer from lack of confidence. If anything, he is overconfident in his abilities … His upside is considerable, but there are a lot of variables that must be addressed for him to get there … ",": Extremely raw … Doesn’t seem to fully understand how to utilize his physical gifts yet, which is why him leaving after one season is a definite head scratcher … Jumpshot is flat, low trajectory, and lacks a fluid release … His shooting motion is in need of reconstruction as he sort of slings the ball with a release that lacks touch or consistency … Inability to shoot is a major concern, making Goodwin a likely long term project as a NBA contributor … Defenders will be able to sag off him and dare him to shoot, thus neutralizing his driving ability until he resolves his shooting issues … Makes a lot of highlight plays, but gets caught up in playing hero ball far too often and loses touch with team basketball … Was used at the point guard position when Ryan Harrow sat early in the year and his lack of point guard skills became very apparent … Lacks great vision, which is a major detriment considering he is so ball dominant … Decision making came under fire as he had numerous games where he forced things, with out of control drives bowling over defenders, and drawing charges and turning the ball over … ""I can’t coach you"" was a documented quote that Coach Cal said to Goodwin at one point late in the season. There are legitimate concerns about Goodwin’s coach-ability and maturity level. Therefore how well he interviews and tests with team’s psych evaluators will be crucial for him … Still has a long ways to go in learning to play off the ball, how to set up screens and spotting up … Basic Shooting Guard 101 … A strong candidate to be a second contract contributor … His lack of readiness creates a real fear and it could be 3-4 years down the line before a team is able to capitalize on his upside … With his proficiency at getting by defenders and into the paint, it would benefit him to develop a runner in order not to draw charges or get shots blocked by Oak Trees in the paint … While a solid defender in college due to his top shelf athleticism and length, he could become much better with some attention to fundamentals and not gambling on steals … His defensive ISO numbers were poor as he bites on fakes and reaches too often … Hit just 17 of 64 three pointers on the season, 26.6% … 64% from the line is on the low end for a 2 guard, and it would benefit him greatly to improve on it as a guard that thrives on attacking the basket … ",6-5,189,SG,Kentucky,Fr.,2013

CJ Wilcox,": Deadly long range shooter who also brings some ball skills and above average athleticism to the equation … As his role grew larger, he added new facets to his game and increased his efficiency … Great mechanics as a shooter, gets up high on jumpers and shot at a very high level from both mid- and long-range during his time in college … Ability also increased as a playmaker, averaged 2.5 apg to 1.7 topg during his senior season … Standard size and length for a SG, averaged a steal and block per game during his junior and senior years … Lateral quickness gives him some potential as a perimeter defender, gives him extra intrigue as a two way player … Became much more confident and efficient when driving to the basket every season since he became a starter for Washington … One of the better percentage FT shooters in all of college basketball at 87.3% in his last year and 83.9% over his college tenure … Accustomed to moving without the ball and coming off of screens, his role will be to stretch the floor, has done it consistently …  Played a high number of minutes during his time at UW, only had a single game his senior year under 30+ minutes … Was a team leader during his time in college, high intangible player who has improved steadily and brings a professional attitude as well as experience … Time at Washington has allowed him to play against a number of high level players in the Seattle area and during his tenure as a Huskie, knows what it takes when it comes to competing with next level talent ",": Creating offense is not his specialty, never got to the level as an all-around scorer that many believed he had the ability to get to … Slight build, can be moved off of position physically, will probably never be much of a threat to drive in the NBA … His ability from the FT stripe is thus off set as a he rarely gets to the line … Defensive awareness and tenacity can be questionable, certainly questions as to how well he will translate to the NBA on that end … Is already 23-years old and will turn 24 before end of the new year, his potential is pretty limited … While he can put the ball on the floor, not someone you want as your primary handler, can use work to tighten handle … Like many shooters, can sometimes settle and can be forced off optimal spots, lacks a great deal of versatility on offense … Suffered a stress fracture in his foot during his junior season, eventually underwent preventative surgery and seemed to show no ill affects, though definitely something to monitor … Went through a tough shooting stretch at the end of the conference season, shot well below average from long range over last two months of season, again something to look at as far as the possible cause ",6-5,201,SG,Washington,Sr.,2014
KJ McDaniels,": KJ is obviously an outstanding athlete; he can jump really easily off two feet or of one without any difference. In the last year he finally used this gift to become one of the best rebounders in his conference while only 6’6 … He is particularly dangerous on the offensive glass, where if he doesn’t have a body on him he knows how to get the crowd involved with spectacular tip dunks … Transition is another area where he shines, both as a ball handler or runner on the wing, when he has the ball and there is nobody in his lane he goes strong to the basket,  very often making the right decision … When he is off the ball in transition he’s often catching lobs and alley-oops … This part of his game will really stand out in the NBA, particularly for teams with good PGs and that like to push the ball in transition … He also added to his game a respectable 3 point jumper, not very pretty to see but definately to be respected … He has very good percentages with his feet set … Despite the offensive reasons the real gem of McDaniels game for NBA scouts is his defense … He has outstanding efficiency numbers defending the ISO according to Synergy and he can guard 1-2-3 without any problems due to his length and quickness … He his very good of the ball as well, reading screens and situations. Thanks to his feet being in constant movement, he is really hard to post up, and this allowed Clemson to play him as a “4” in a small lineup. He is not by any mean an offensive threat but was still able to average more than 17ppg which could allow any NBA coach looking for a new “Tony Allen” to play him without risking to play 4 on 5 on the offensive hand ",": His biggest weakness right now is still his offensive game … His shot is getting better, particularly his 3 pointer with his feet set, but when defenders run him off the line he has a very poor pull up shooting and his decision making is highly questionable … Needs to develop a mid-range game and learn how to finish around the rim … Right now when he gets to the rim but can’t dunk, he struggles to finish, especially with his left hand … Seems to suffer a lot when defenders get into his body, which raises some questions about his attitude to fight and be strong durin a physical game … He will never need to be a great scorer, but needs to be consistent enough where he can punish the defense with open shots and precise cuts …  Ball handling also needs some work, his one on one often finish with a turnover as McDaniels often struggles to read the help … Defensively he needs to embrace the role that will be for him in the NBA, get stronger to defend stronger players, but all those are just natural developments that will occur in his career … Overall he will definitely have to struggle to find his spot in the League but without any doubt he could be the guy many coaches and GM are looking for to add athleticism and a defensive stopper on a good team … Rick Fois 5/3/14 Strengths: You can’t talk about McDaniels without bringing up his ridiculous athletic ability … Really is a trampoline in the open floor and shows electric speed and leaping skills around the rim … A highlight waiting to happen … Looks the part of an NBA wing, standing a true 6’6 200 lbs with a wiry strong build…More than adequate length for either wing position…Likes to dunk the ball…Could very well be the most explosive athlete in the 2014 class…Runs the floor very well…Pretty reactive player who plays a livewire style and should an above average nose for the ball…Really good offensive rebounder, and shows the ability to soar over defenders for dunks around the rim…Attacks the rim pretty well with his ability to go in straight lines…Is a reasonable shooter out to 22 ft and is able to hit open jump shots with decency, but is still a work in progress…Gets to the foul line at an impressive rate and is a very good shooter when there (5.4 ftpg at 84% as a Jr)…His free throw percentage is encouraging for teams hoping he can continue to improve his jumper in the future…Willing rebounder who understands where to be on the glass…Clearly an elite shot-blocker for a wing prospect, averaging almost 3 blocks a night as a Jr…Has the potential to defend either wing spot and has all the athletic tools to be an effective defender in the NBA as well…A late blooming prospect who began to legitimately open eyes in the NIT, but had a breakout season after making good improvement in each of his 3 years at Clemson…Has some experience playing PF, and has an adequate post game for a projected wing player…Made impressive improvements to his game every year in college, and got better in every statistical category from his Soph. to Jr. season…Plays the style of game that could make him an intriguing fan favorite in the right system  ",6-6,196,SF,Clemson,Jr.,2014
PJ Hairston,": Hairston is a very effective scorer, both inside and out …  Has a sweet jump shot with deep range – good elevation and a quick release …  Though mostly a spot-up shooter, he’s dangerous off the dribble and off screens in catch-and-shoot situations … Uses step-back and fade-away moves very effectively … Makes overly aggressive on-the-ball defenders pay with a quick first step to the basket … With a sturdy build and a 37-inch vertical, he has no trouble getting to the rim and finishing through contact … Draws a lot of fouls, and is an excellent free-throw shooter …  Terrific finisher in transition … Doesn’t have a flashy handle, but is relatively good at protecting the ball … Played some as a stretch 4 at North Carolina, and while he won’t do that in the NBA, the solidly built youngster has the potential to expand his game as a post-up guard … When motivated, has active hands and comes up with a fair amount of steals … Does not lack for confidence …  ",":  Due to a combination of a lack of effort, a lack of awareness, and below-average speed and quickness, Hairston is a poor defender … In one-on-one situations, he is often abused by quicker players on both cuts and drives to the basket … As team defender, he is often in the wrong place at the wrong time – he doesn’t always rotate, and when he does, he has poor recovery speed. Also, at times, he inexplicably steps away from the action, as if he is playing with five fouls or playing for the Washington Generals … Appears undisciplined, lackadaisical – doesn’t make a lot of hustle plays, stands around a lot on offense, and often jogs down the floor on defense … An offensive black hole – once he gets the ball, it is never seen again … Averaged just .8 assists per game in the D-league this past season … His confidence can work against him as he appears to think that he’s a stronger talent than he is, leading to questionable work ethic, and possible trouble accepting a secondary role on a team … Body language while at UNC early in the season was, to be blunt, atrocious …    ",6-5,228,SG,USA,Jr.,2014
Spencer Dinwiddie,": Dinwiddie is a dual offensive threat, who averaged 18.9 points and 4.1 assists per 40 minutes over his last two seasons at Colorado … Dangerous in transition – glides down the floor and slithers his way to the basket … Smooth. Good body control and great touch on his floaters … Uses nifty hop and Euro steps to get to the rim…  Draws a bunch of fouls, averaging 9 FTA per 40 over his last two seasons at CU … Excellent free-throw shooter, making better than 81 percent of his attempts in each of his three seasons at CU … Solid three-point shooter, making more than 41 percent of his attempts in two of his three seasons with the Buffalos … Very effective scoring and finding open perimeter shooters when driving off the pick and roll … Tallest player classified as a point guard at the combine – his height allows him to shoot unimpeded and easily find open teammates … Makes crisp interior passes … Good off-the-ball defense – denies very well … Fast – gets down the floor quickly and can stick with talented scorers, such as Marcus Smart and Andrew Wiggins, on defense … High character guy with good intelligence. Seemingly a good teammate – enthusiastic, likable, expressive, involved, and shares the ball …  ",": Dinwiddie’s most glaring weakness is his lack of assertiveness and consistency. Scouts often wonder why his level of intensity is not at the same level at all time. Should look to be a little more selfish (assertive). Has standout ability but doesn’t always take it upon himself to be the star that he should be … Still recovering from a torn ACL that he suffered in January …  Questionable whether he is a true point guard or more a combo –  frequently played off the ball at CU, though excels in ball handling and passing … Slender build – bounces off stronger players on both ends of the floor … Avoids contact when driving – prefers to pull up or pass out rather than go all the way to the hole … Limited dribble moves … Doesn’t show much ability to create his own shot, frequently relying of screens to get open … Too dependent on his right hand – shoots with his right on drives to the left side of the rim…  Easily picked off by screens on the defensive side of the ball, which is seemingly due to a combination of a lack of awareness and strength …  ",6-6,205,PG/SG,Colorado,Jr.,2014
Vasilje Micic,": Standing 6’5” he has an elite size for the PG position, with a sturdy frame that will allow him to face the physicality of the NBA (he was able to withstand the physical presence of Marcus Smart last summer during U19 WC) … Owns elite passing ability that few PGs in the NBA and Europe possess … His height affords him great court vision in pick and roll situations, where he shows amazing passing ability and glimpses of pure creativity … In pick and roll situations, he’s really effective in exploiting the screens to create the space for the shot or to attack the basket with his solid handle … He has great body control and remarkable use of fakes with a big bag of tricks, including change of speed and directions … He has a natural instinct and feel for the game, combined with a great maturity and basketball IQ … Despite his young age, with his maturity and game comprehension he’s a great playmaker, his assist to turnover ratio is excellent and he does a great job in controlling the tempo both in half court and transition situations … He has excellent defensive fundamentals and sense of position, showing a great attitude also in pressuring the ball … Extremely strong mentally and shows great leadership …  ",": Average athlete, not extremely quick, he has poor lateral speed and he’s not explosive … His torn ACL could still present a red flag … His other big flaw is that he’s not a consistent shooter, especially behind the three point line (29% this season in ABA league) and after the pick and roll, he should work on his mechanics and release, which is usually rushed when shooting from the dribble … He lacks a solid midrange game, especially his pull-up jumper, even if he has shown some improvements through the season … His playmaking is really instinctive, he could struggle when forced to play something different than basic set games and simple pick and rolls … On the defensive side he struggles against smaller and quicker opponents due to his poor lateral quickness …  ",6-6,202,PG,Serbia,Intl.,2014
Mitch McGary,": A bigman who is quick for his size … Possesses a high basketball IQ and can do damage offensively as a playmaker … Not explosive vertically but moves well laterally with good control … Willing to do the dirty work; hustles and seeks ""garbage bucket"" opportunities … Solid finisher around the rim with crafty post moves … A willing passer out of the post … Combined with his soft hands, should have the ability to develop go-to back-to-basket moves long term …  At 6’10"" 255 lbs. has an adequate 7′ wingspan, and a very surprising 8’11.5 standing reach, giving him legitimate center size … Very physical and uses size and strength to his advantage… Can tire out opponents the way he constantly throws his weight around… Appears to be a team player.  Practices with a positive attitude.  This bodes well for him fitting in as a role player in the NBA… Plays with passion and aggressiveness… Still has room for improvement, but did up his free throw percentage from 44% to 68% (although in limited attempts) from freshman to sophomore seasons… Through eight games in his sophomore season, averaged 8.3 boards in just 24.8 minutes… Offensively plays within himself; does not turn the ball over at a high rate (1.2 TO in 20 mpg as a freshman and 1.6 TO in 25 mpg as a sophomore) and takes high percentage shots (60% and 55% during his freshman and sophomore seasons, respectively)… ",": Simply has not played much basketball at a high level yet. A bit of an unknown in this regard.  Has potential, but other than strong 2013 NCAA Tournament, is unproven … Not explosive; think more Kevin Love than Blake Griffin, athletically … Work ethic and conditioning have been questioned, but hustles hard when on the court … Not known for low block scoring at this point, but has all of the tools to develop go-to moves … The lefty’s face up jumper is often rushed and without solid mechanics; has a lot of room for improvement before he is an effective pick and pop option … Due to aggressive play may be somewhat foul prone … Plays with a great deal of emotion and energy so there is some fear that he can only play at a high level in spurts and may struggle to sustain his level of play throughout an entire 82 game season … Though just a sophomore, he’s the age of a senior, limiting his upside … ",6-10,266,C,Michigan,So.,2014
Damien Inglis,": He has an astonishing combination of size, physical skills, length and speed … He’s already well developed from the muscular standpoint, especially in the upper body, with long arms and strong hands … His solid body structure allows him to effectively withstand contact, and to attack the basket without struggles even at senior level, plus he has shown the ability to exploit his size by posting up smaller and weaker opponents … He has remarkable passing skills and ball handling abilities … He tends to switch to the PG position on offense, exploiting his ability to beat his direct defender to create for himself and his teammates … He loves to attack the basket in ISO situations, exploiting his physical skills and his speed, with a slashing style of game … He plays with energy and intensity giving an effective contribution in various aspects of the game, he’s also a good rebounder for his position … On the defensive side he puts great pressure exploiting his body and quick hands.  ",": His shooting is the biggest flaw and a point of concern, even if he has shown significant improvements since last year, especially from three point … His mechanics in particular needs several adjustments, both from a quickness and release standpoint … His game comprehension and playmaking skills are still rather raw,  bad decision making leads to frequent turnovers, especially when put under pressure by his defender … At the youth level his game was based on physical domination, but with the increase in level of opponents, his effectiveness has significantly decreased … On the defensive side he has terrific potential, but he’s not consistent and he lacks the fundamentals of positioning in a structured system … As highlighted by Michael Visenberg during the Hoop Summit, his focus and attitude are a red flag, which limit his consistency during games … His bad body language and poor determination could really limit his appeal, despite he possessing first round talent.

Johnny O'Bryant,": Light on his feet and solidly built, the 6-foot-9, 257-pound O’Bryant looks the part of an NBA power forward …  A versatile interior scorer, O’Bryant improved his scoring average and shooting percentage in each of his three seasons at LSU …  A triple-threat offensively – can score off the drive, in the post, or from midrange with his jumper.  Uses a variety of impressive spin moves in the post, can make hook shots and layups with either hand, and has a midrange fade-away that is difficult to defend … The range on his jump shot extends past 22 feet, though he is far more reliable inside 15 feet … According to Hoop-Math.com, O’Bryant made 69 percent of his shots at the rim and 40 percent of his two-point jumpers this past season, both above-average numbers …  Effectively uses his sturdy body – not easily moved in the post, not fazed by contact, and draws a good number of fouls (7.3 FTA per 40 minutes this past season) …  Has active hands and a nose for the ball …  Sets solid screens …  A solid rebounder, especially on the offensive end of the floor …  Motivated, involved, coachable, and levelheaded …  Showed steady physical and mental improvement throughout his career at LSU … Transformed his body between sophomore and junior seasons and is moving much better with the new, svelte body … Appears to have the length and strength to play both PF and center at the NBA level …   ",": Turnover prone – averaged 4.3 turnovers per 40 minutes this past season …  Often reacts too slowly to double teams, and throws errant passes or travels as a result …  Doesn’t have an explosive first step, and has trouble beating his man off the dribble …  Sometimes overestimates his dribble/drive skills and finds himself with no place to go with the ball, with the end result being a turnover or a forced shot … Does not block many shots, not so much because he’s vertically challenged but because he is not aggressive in terms of challenging shots…  Not overly physical on either end of the floor, and sometimes falls in love with his finesse game on the offensive end…  Has below-average speed and doesn’t score much in transition … Can finish with authority, but doesn’t do it as often as he should … Not a great foul shooter, making fewer than 64 percent of his attempts … Conditioning could be better – needs to convert some of his baby fat into muscle … Playing at the 5 spot in college, he is not a tested perimeter defender…  ",6-8,257,PF/C,LSU,Jr.,2014

To Soph. season … Seems like he should develop a good change of pace PG …  ",": Jump shooting is the one thing teams will need to see from Christon in workouts before they can decide where to select him in the draft … Right now his jumper is a work in progress, and although he shot a decent 3-point % as a Soph (38%), it was on less than 2 attempts a game … Doesn’t seem to have real confidence in his shot, and extending his range is probably going to take time, and some tweaking of his form … Teams will dare him to shoot in the screen game … A pretty raw player at the moment, needs more experience … Also is a developing floor general in need of true PG instincts … Doesn’t dictate pace that well, and struggles to get teammates involved as well as he should if it isn’t a drive and dish situation … Shows a fairly loose handle for a PG prospect when he can’t break defenses down with his pure speed … Is particularly shaky when he has to use his left hand, and looks uncomfortable when handling or slashing to his left side … Mediocre floor vision and tends to get selfish and force action at times…Free throw shooting needs improvement … Will need to add weight to his frame … ",6-3,186,PG,Xavier,So.,2014
Khem Birch,": With a 7-foot-1 wingspan and a 35.5-inch vertical, Birch is an exceptional shot blocker – averaged 4.8 blocks per 40 minutes this past season at UNLV … A solid team defender – shows hard, has good recovery speed, erases shots from the weak side, covers a lot of ground, and generally disruptive to opposing offenses…  Runs the floor well, and can finish above the rim with ease …  Offensive game is mostly facing up and creating against slower big men, as well as utilizing his athleticism at the rim … Underused as a passer, but is capable of being an effective playmaker in transition and from the post …  Good rebounder, especially on the offensive end of the floor … Exhibits decent ball handling skills at times … For a big man, he doesn’t foul very much (2.9 PF per 40 minutes this past season), and he knows how to play when he is in foul trouble …   ",": Very limited on the offensive end – most of his points come on put-backs, on cuts to the basket off the pick and roll, or in transition … According Hoop-Math.com, nearly 70 percent of Birch’s shots came at the rim this past season, and he made a modest 62 percent of those shots.  Also, he made less than 27 percent of his shots away from the rim … Working on a hook shot, but currently has no go-to post move…  Inconsistent form on his midrange shots …  Shooting form is generally awkward … Lacks much in the way of a back to the basket post game … Not strong enough to covert offensive putbacks the way he should … Has the ability to drive, but struggles to finish through contact …  Easily outmuscled and pushed around in the post when matched against bigger players…  Doesn’t set solid screens …  Not very physical or aggressive … Needs to add considerable strength to his frame …  ",6-9,209,PF,UNLV,Jr.,2014

Walter Tavares,": Standing 7-3, with an astonishing wingspan of 7-9 he has tremendous size, combined with excellent mobility for a big man with his dimensions … He’s always active on the floor, showing great progresses from a conditioning standpoint, compared to when he arrived on the Canary Islands … Offensively he’s really effective in pick and roll situations, showing the ability to finish above the rim after the cut with aggressiveness, furthermore his mobility and coordination make him an effective contributor in creating space for his teammates with solid screens, playing a key role in Gran Canarias offense .. Most of his offensive repertoire is based on dunks and put backs after an offensive rebound, but he has shown significant improvements on his hook shot using his right hand … He has a soft touch and he’s a solid free throw shooter … Defensively he’s a great pick and roll defender, being able to recover in the painted area after helping on the screen … Plus with his great size and wingspan he’s definitely a great rim protector. According to those with knowledge of him, he’s a nice, humble guy with a great work ethic … ",": He lacks explosiveness and elite athleticism, furthermore as per all the big man of comparable size, the physical and muscular improvement must be developed carefully, in order to avoid back and structural problems … Offensively he’s still rather raw, he lacks post moves and struggles to effectively take position in the painted area … Furthermore his lack of solid ball handling skills makes it difficult for him to create his own shot, often relying on offensive rebounds and assists from teammates … Despite his size he’s not yet an elite rebounder, since he lacks effective positioning and a natural understanding of the game … These shortcomings also affect his defensive effectiveness: he jumps on shot fakes too often, committing unnecessary fouls …  ",7-3,260,C,Spain,Intl.,2014
Alessandro Gentile,": Although he’s still young (not yet 21), he has been playing professionally since he was 16 with enough success to be considered one of the future stars of Italian basketball … It took him some time to adjust his game to the senior level, but his greatest strength is the confidence that he has in himself … Sometimes perceived as arrogant, and there may be some truth in that, he seems to have matured considerably over the last 6 months … As a big 6’7 guard, Gentile is very skilled and aggressive when he decides to attack the rim … His ability to attack openings and finish around the rim handling contacts makes him potentially one of the most dominant players in Europe for the next 10/15 years … He is sort of the ""Italian Melo"" in the style of physicality and nose for scoring that he brings to the table. In Europe, he reminds of the great Sasha Danilovic in how easily he can put the ball on the floor to attack the close out, despite being so tall and big and how skilled he is in controlling his body and making the right decision … Left and right are equally adept, and when he’s around the rim, he can finish with floaters, power moves or nice finger rolls … Combined with his physicality and the control of his body explains his success in transition, where he often explodes for powerful dunks … His post game is very effective and being such a big guard, he knows how to take advantage of it, though he definitely likes to attack opponents from the dribble first and foremost… A big plus is the movement without the ball, he understand the game and moves without it to free himself to get open … Defensively he uses his body strength and good foot speed to create problems to his opponents, though he is not an elite defender he is extremely competitive and doesn’t mind taking on the opponent’s best player …  ",": Despite the “Space Jam” statistics he is putting up at the 2013 Eurobasket, the biggest dark cloud surrounding his NBA future is the mechanics of his shooting … The little hitch (pause) before his release has had a terrible effect on his shooting percentages over the last year … But on the bright side, this kid is highly competitive and is aware of it, so for certain he will work on it … Lack of consistency and confidence in his shot creates a lot of problems for him. He uses screens mainly to create an advantage to attack the basket, instead of shooting … In the same way he uses pick and roll, mostly hoping the defense will switch to take advantage of that … He will also struggle in the league because of his lack of athleticism and explosiveness; most of his game right now is based on overpowering defenders generally smaller or slower than him … In the NBA he will face players just as strong that are faster and more athletic. So continuing to develop his shooting and scoring ability will be key … Two other aspects remain very concerning for NBA scouts: His shots selection and his attitude … As we discussed his “overconfidence” leads to sometimes making bad choices on offense and though he seems to be very mature, I would expect him to impact the game in more ways than just scoring … 2.5 rebounds are too small of a number for a 6’7 player who is playing in an Italian national team with only two bigs and not any outstanding athletes … His attitude, which was a major red flag in the past, seems to have turned the corner in recent months, and being a leadership position will be absolutely beneficial for him under this aspect. One last question that must be asked is how strong his desire is to play in the NBA. Would he prefer to be a superstar in Italy, or a role player in the NBA?  ",6-7,230,SG/SF,Italy,Intl.,2014
Cameron Bairstow,": Bairstow is a brute with the ability to knock down the mid range jumper … Hustles extremely hard and will bang down low … Will give up his body for the good of the team … Puts a lot of pressure on his man to be physical; gets to the free throw line (8.8 FTA in 2013-14 was good for 4th nationally in this category) … Crashes the boards, has a great motor … Really works for post position, and good at sealing his man … Does the majority of his work offensively in the lane and on the block, but can also knock down elbow and baseline jumpers … Was one of the nation’s most improved players between the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons; even showed the ability to do some shot blocking his senior season, although this may not ultimately translate as a part of his pro game … Has good measurables for the power forward position (has almost identical measurements and athleticism numbers to draft-class mate Julius Randle) … High percentage shooter (74% FT Shooter, 56% FG senior season with Lobos) … ",": Born in 1990, he will turn 24 later this season, decreasing his upside substantially … Below the rim athlete and below average athlete by NBA standards … In college was able to overpower opponents; may be a different story in the pros … Relatively inexperienced, having arguably only played a significant role for the Lobos his senior season … Still developing in terms of his feel for the game … Not particularly effective on the fast break … Prone to ""tunnel vision"" offensively, where once he commits to a move, he loses awareness of teammates and help defense … ",6-10,252,PF,New Mexico,Sr.,2014

Strange body with thick arms and legs and skinny torso, very low shoulders and long neck. His standing reach will likely be smaller than the average player with his dimensions … Needs to add more muscle to be able to stay on balance on drives … Needs to become more consistent inside the arc and sometimes struggles to finish at the rim … His defensive ability on the perimeter is a bit of a mystery after playing in the Syracuse 2-3 zone for four seasons … Should look to become more vocal … Has average length, not much longer than his height … Born in Sept 1991, so he’s a year old for a senior, affecting his potential slightly … Listed at 6’8, but appears closer to 6’6, and lacks a large wingspan (measured at 6’9 at the LeBron Skills camp in 2012) ….

Alec Brown,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Matt Bullard Stengths: At 7’1"" Alec not only has legitimate NBA center height but also is one of the best shooters in the 2014 NBA Draft … He consistently can hit shot after shot from well beyond the 3 point line …  With 29% of all his shots taken from 3 he was able to make them at a 42% clip and an overall field goal percentage at 47% …  He displays good agility, height, and a solid understanding of his offensive strengths … He can run the floor and is a very dangerous trailer hitting the top of the key jump shot or the occasional dunk … And his strength in the pros should be as a stretch 4 or 5 and used as a pick and pop player on the offensive end.  On the defensive end he was also able to average over 3 blocks per game.  Coming from a mid major Alec was able to give a positive impression to scouts at Adidas Nations while going against some of the best players in college basketball. ",": Alec’s lack of physical strength is an obvious weakness, as he shies away from contact and struggles to play in the post against bigger and stronger opponents … Despite having great height at center his lack of strength would make him a liability on defense and he may not have the strength to guard an NBA center and instead rather be used in a zone or as a 4 … Also because of his lack of strength he has difficulty creating shots for himself in the post … He will need to improve his defensive prowess to become a rotational player at the next level … His rebounding statistics of 5.7 per game is not at the level you would like for a 7 footer in a mid major conference … Furthermore statistically speaking there are two outlier games against poor competition that benefited his overall statistical average where he had a triple double including 10 blocks versus Minnesota-Duluth and a 40 point game versus Fairfield … Alec had an opportunity in his non conference schedule to play Wisconsin and go head to head versus Frank Kaminsky and played arguably his worst game of the season fouling out in 18 minutes, with 5 turnovers and scoring only 2 points … Unfortunately for Alec, the trend of poor games with foul trouble against top opponents continued throughout the season as he failed to reach double figures versus Virginia, Wisconsin Milwaukee, and Belmont …  ",7-1,231,PF/C,Wisconsin Gre...,Sr.,2014

Deonte Burton NV,": Strong, aggressive point guard with a knack for getting to the rim and finishing … Explosive athlete who routinely delivers highlight-reel dunks … Great scorer in transition … Good ball-handler and shot creator … Good perimeter defender thanks to his wingspan (6’6"") and lateral quickness … High-motor player who always comes to play … Excellent at drawing fouls, drawing nearly 7 attempts from the line per game … Great body control makes him an even better finisher at the rim … Fairly quick first step … With his length, strength, and athleticism, he plays much bigger than his size … Displays solid control when he’s on the floor with the ball in his hands … Can dribble with either hand and drive in either direction … Quick hands, averaged 1.5 SPG … Solid outside shooter, especially on the catch-and-shoot.  Though he shot just 31% from behind the arc this season … Great endurance and physical fitness.  Burton averages over 38.5 minutes per game … This could make him a great energy guy off the bench … Has improved his shooting percentages dramatically each of the past two years, indicating an improved shot and better shot selection … Also improved his A/TO ratio considerably as a senior … ",": Has point guard size, but he’s not a great distributor …  Only averages 4.5 assists per 40 minutes …  Some of this is due to a lack of talent around him, but he often dribbles with no intent of finding open teammates …Another red flag is the lack of success Nevada had in his time there …  Nevada had a losing record in three out of Burton’s four seasons, including his junior and senior year … His shooting isn’t always consistent and part of this is due to iffy shot selection … Has unorthodox shooting mechanics and has a long shot release … Upside? Will be nearly 23 come draft time, much older than many of his draft class peers … ",6-1,193,PG/SG,Nevada,Sr.,2014
Joe Harris,": One the better three-point shooters in the draft, Harris finished his four-year college career second all-time in 3-point percentage (40.7%) and 3-pointers (263) at Virginia…  His forte is the catch-and-shoot – he moves tirelessly without the ball, using screens and misdirection to get open…  While he is by no means an isolation player, Harris does have a solid handle and effectively uses ball fakes, step-backs, crossovers, and hesitations to create space for his shot or go to the hole…  Not overly flashy, but is a very effective passer – anticipates well and quickly delivers to the open man.  Averaged 3.2 assists per 40 minutes as a senior at UVA…  Not an elite athlete, but is a fairly sticky defender – always has one eye on his man and the other eye on the ball, anticipates well (again), and avoids being picked off by screens by taking proper angles…  Tough and durable – broke a bone in his left hand vs. North Carolina (2/11/12) and played the rest of that game and the last eight games of that season with protection on the hand.  Also, ranks first all-time at Virginia in games played (135)…  Has great intangibles – awareness, unselfishness, fortitude, and leadership…  ",": Harris has below-average speed and struggles with faster opponents on both ends of the floor…  Disappears at times, offensively – because he relies heavily on off-the-ball movement to get open and is adverse to taking potentially contested outside shots, he can be neutralized by a sticky man-to-man defender or good team defense…  Not vertically explosive and has a short wingspan (6’6’’), and as a result, does not excel as a rebounder, a shot blocker, and a finisher…  Made a subpar 56.3 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, according to HoopMath.com…  Struggled from the free-throw line as a senior, making just 64 percent of his attempts.  It was the second straight season that his FT percentage dropped.  He made a career-high 77.2% as a sophomore…   ",6-6,215,SG/SF,Virginia,Sr.,2014

In four years at St. Joseph’s, Roberts never attempted a three-point shot, and according to Hoop–Math.com, he shot just 31% away from the rim …  Poor free-throw shooter, making less than 60% of his attempts at St. Joe’s …  Sometimes stagnant on the offensive end of the floor, standing around and not fighting to get open…  Not an elite shot blocker or defensive rebounder, averaging a modest 1.6 and 5.4 per 40 in those respective categories as a senior …  ",6-8,215,PF,St. Joseph's,Sr.,2014

Jordan Mickey,": Productive player showing scoring, rebounding and shot blocking abilities … Mickey is an elite shot blocker at the college level having averaged over 3 blocks per game for his career …  He’s extremely athletic and has great timing when blocking opponents shots in the paint … He’s an improving offensive player with a great face up game … He has added range to his jumper this season and has become a better post player as well … He’s aggressive when attacking the basket on both ends of the floor and has become one of the better rebounders in the college game after struggling with that during his freshman season … He’s got great length (7’2 wingspan)  that helps make up for his lack of true PF (6’7.5) height …  He’s an elite help defender and has active hands … He is a smart player and has a high basketball IQ … Very self aware and knows what it will take to get him to the next level and has really worked on each of those things since his freshman year …  Extremely active and has a great motor … ",": The biggest drawback to Mickey’s game is that he lacks height and strength for the PF position and doesn’t really possess wing skills at this point, but that is something that his length and athleticism should help him to overcome … He isn’t a great post defender due to his lack of size.  He’ll need to continue to get stronger so that bigger guys don’t bully him in the post … Although he has made strides with his offensive game, his footwork and back to the basket game leaves a lot to be desired … He is still turnover prone (over three per game) particularly in the post when teams double him … Still isn’t as consistent with his jump shot as you would want and he isn’t fluid just yet but mechanics can be fixed with the right coaching …   ",6-8,240,PF,LSU,So.,2015

Terran Petteway,": Petteway is a talented wing scorer with size and experience … He can score in all kinds of ways, be it outside or inside, on the catch-and-shoot or on a shot of his own creation … Has a knack for filling up the basket … Has a solid repertoire of guard skills for a player of his size (6’6"" with a 6’11"" wingspan) …  Can put the ball on the floor and shoot it from outside … Brings the right mentality to the game, great energy, team player …  Ultra-competitive guy who is constantly engaged and constantly aggressive … Always looking to make a play when he has the ball in his hands … Good step-back jumper.  That’s one of his signature moves … His great wingspan and high motor make him a solid perimeter defender … Good distributor for his position … Can run an offense in a pinch (especially the pick-and-roll) and knows how to create for himself and for his teammate …  Averaged a healthy 2.8 assists per game last year in 35 minutes per game … Does a pretty good job of drawing fouls and getting to the line … Brings his tenacity to the aspect of rebounding … Averaged nearly 5 boards per game, a pretty good number for a wing … Great in transition … Can push the ball and finish well … Good body control … Knows how to make space as he finishes and get the ball up and around bigger defenders … All in all, a crafty finisher … Good teammate. Very supportive and positive. Mature. …  He was the catalyst in Nebraska’s surge at the end of the 2013-2014 season in which they got super hot in conference play and snagged a rare tournament bid for the school … Finished third in the conference in scoring last season with 18.2 PPG, which isn’t bad considering defenses put a lot of focus on him as Nebraska’s main offensive threat … ",": Petteway is a high-volume shooter who isn’t always the most efficient player on the court.  His shooting percentage was under 40% last season … Takes a lot of long pull-up jumpers from inside the arc, which is one of the least efficient shots one can take … He’s very confident but at times, it can be over confidence as he forces bad shots … All in all, he’s overly reliant on pull-up jumpers, although part of his shot selection woes can be attributed to the fact that Nebraska had very few viable offensive options … Can be too aggressive at times, to the point of being out of control … Averaged a whopping 3.4 turnovers per game last season, a huge number for a non-point guard … Not a standout athlete … His combine numbers were very underwhelming, though his wingspan helps him … His standing vert and max vert were both the fifth-lowest of 49 players measured at the combine, which includes plenty of big men … Also was determined to be fairly skinny at the combine, weighing in at 209 lbs … Granted, he’s fearless attacking the rim and gets a fair amount of highlight jams, all things considered … His body fat was very low, but he may need to put on muscle to guard NBA 3’s, as he may lack the quickness to guard NBA 2’s … Has a slight tendency to get lost on defense off the ball … Not a great free throw shooter for how often he gets to the line.  Shot 71% from the stripe last season. Not horrible but must improve … ",6-6,210,SF,Nebraska,Jr.,2015
Joseph Young,": One of the NCAA’s top scorers over the past few seasons, has many ways to create offense … Great jump shooter, was highly effective from all three levels … Dangerous with and without the ball … Ran the pick-and-roll well, while also doing great things as a spot-up shooter … Sneaky athleticism, does not necessarily have blow by speed, but nice change of direction … Did a lot more work at the point this year, doubled his assist total while posting a 1.58:1 assist-to-turnover ratio … Made good decisions in transition, scored a lot of his points and often made the right play … His efficiency closer to the rim improved as a senior … Showed more aggression as a rebounder, which is a positive sign for his intensity on the floor … Defended both guard positions, shows toughness and a good idea of where people are on the floor … Led team beyond expectations, thrives as an underdog and does not back down from a challenge … High volume shooter who still managed to shoot a solid percentage from the field, particularly from inside the arc during his last two seasons … One of the NCAA’s top FT shooters, got to the line at a decent rate while shooting 92.5% as a senior, 90% during his time at Oregon … He is someone you need to take stock in when he cuts to the basket, no hesitation and a very competent finisher … Played big minutes during his last few seasons in college, very well conditioned … ",": Still much more of a SG in a PG’s body, which makes him quite undersized by NBA standards … Team was much better off when someone else was the primary ball handler, he had difficulty proving that he can play the point at the next level … Like most shooters can be streaky. He had a very rough patch from long range at the start of the season with his three point percentage dropping to 35.7% this past season (from 41.5% the season before) … Will need to work on moving his feet when guarding the ball, often did not display his best possible effort when defending in isolation … Will need to be able to defend point guards and will need to show more intensity … Did not get a huge amount of steals, plus he is not a very imposing target to shoot over … Rarely shot off of screens, will need to become much more accustomed to doing so … Driving right and coming off of his screens to his left shoulder are both things he needs to work on … While turnovers were not a huge issue, he did turn it over much more than usual as he played more PG … Drove to the basket much less this year, another sign of his doing his best work off of the ball … ",6-2,185,PG/SG,Oregon,Sr.,2015
Luis Montero,": Big guard with great versatility to play 3 positions … Has logged time at point guard … Explosive, smooth and creative player … A good ball handler … Can use a cross over at a high rate of  high speed … A good passer with court vision, always looking for the open man … Smooth. Runs the court very well, excellent in fast break situations, often finishing with dunks … Has a great ability to attack the rim with an arsenal of moves …  Can use the Euro step, change directions, fakes, finger rolls, floaters … A good shooter from 2 and 3 points, with deep range and good mechanics on his shot … The kind of player capable of creating baskets for himself and for his teammates … Can drive to the basket and open the court and dish for shots for his teammates, or find the bigman under the rim … Good shot blocker, with good timing , very smart playing the passing lanes, anticipates well and also in running the fast break … Great length, with a wingspan of 7-foot-1, and a standing reach of 8-foot-8 … Came into the draft proces weighing 181, and has added 14 pounds of muscle (195 lbs now) showing excellent dedication …  ",": Lack of experience playing at a high level combined with his age (22) … Needs to work a lot on his body strength, must continue to put a lot of muscle in order to handle contact at the NBA level … His shot selection needs to improve … He is an elite level player but hasn’t learned how to play against elite level competition … His body strength will be a problem in 1 on 1 defense, he can’t handle standard SFs at this point, and needs to learn to be more active on rebounds … ",6-7,195,SG/SF,JUCO,So.,2015

Dakari Johnson,": Johnson is a big man (7’0, 255 lbs.) who plays big.  He uses his strength well and is generally the tallest guy on the court … He is an unselfish prospect who became one of the nation’s top role players on one of college basketball’s strongest teams … Does the little things like set screens and box out well that should help him transition to the NBA … Burly big man who uses his strength to get deep post position and great rebounding position.  Simply overpowered people at the college level … An excellent offensive rebounder due to his size, motor, and technique, Johnson ranks fourth among draft prospects in offensive rebound percentage, at 13.5% … Shows some mobility and fluidity for a guy his size …  Improved his body prior to last season and has shown a willingness to get up and down in transition and finish on the pick and roll … Solid shot-blocker.  Averaged 2.3 blocks per 40 minutes due to his size and good instincts … High motor guy who keeps plays alive and made a lot of winning plays en route to an undefeated regular season last year for the Wildcats … ",": Johnson’s ceiling is relatively low.  Essentially, what you saw Johnson doing in college (being a role player, doing little things, not being relied on to score much, even coming off the bench) is what you’ll see him doing in the NBA if he gets a shot … A bit of a pldder … Does not have an NBA-caliber offensive game.  Limited repertoire of post moves and little-to-no range on his jump shot … Doesn’t excel on the defensive glass like he does on the offensive glass because his box-out technique isn’t great, even though the athleticism and strength are there … Though his improved conditioning has helped, Johnson is not particularly athletic or quick and can get caught rotating over too slowly on defense or getting left behind in transition … Also is not much of an above-the-rim player despite his size … Fairly foul-prone, limiting his effectiveness as a defender … Poor free-throw shooter.  Though he raised his percentage from 45% to 63% from his freshman to sophomore year, his mechanics are still poor and he still connects at a very low rate … Despite his size, he’s not great defensively.  Tends to get caught out of position and his length (7’1"") isn’t actually that outstanding, combining with his athleticism to make him somewhat limited as a rim protector … Doesn’t have the lateral quickness to save himself if he gets caught guarding a smaller player on the perimeter … Focus and work ethic could use improvement … ",7-0,260,C,Kentucky,So.,2015
Josh Richardson,": Richardson has great size and length to play shooting guard in the NBA … Listed at 6’6"" with a 6’10"" wingspan … Also possesses great physical tools in terms of athleticism and speed … Fast on the court at all times, with or without the ball in his possession … Has a very good first step … Became a better ball handler with time and ended his time at Tennessee as their primary ball handler … Doesn’t get flustered when having to dribble through traffic … Uses his size well to make plays for other teammates … Was very good working out of the pick and roll … Read the defense well and often found the open teammate … Also good in isolation situations … Showcased above average body control in trips to the lane … His length helps him create and finish shots … An improving three point shooter … Rose his percentage from 24.3 percent as a freshman to 35.9 percent as a senior … Can convert catch and shoot opportunities at a high rate, shot 39.4 percent in such situations last season (50 percent when wide open and 36 percent with a hand in his face) … Smooth release when not rushed … Combination of physicality and energy will help him be a good defender at the next level … Has NBA level size, length and agility on the defensive end … Was great at getting steals and disrupting passing lanes … Averaged 2.1 steals per 40 minutes, ranking sixth amongst NCAA shooting guards last year … Has the potential to develop into a strong ""3 and D"" player in the league …  ",": Needs to develop and grow into his frame … Lacks the strength necessary to handle elite perimeter players defensively … Tends to shy away from contact on both ends of the floor … Converted just 51 percent of his two pointers and didn’t draw many fouls … Has to become a more consistent finisher at the rim … Registered a high amount of turnovers as a senior, his assist to turnover ratio worsened from his junior to senior seasons … Doesn’t have high level vision and often drops his head when dribbling … His form isn’t particularly consistent and wavers when he rushes … Attempts to many contorted and off balance shots when dealing with pressure defense … Gets caught gambling on defense far too often … Played a rover type of role even when the Volunteers were in man (which wasn’t very often) … Doesn’t have a strong or intimidating defensive stance, looked lazy and careless at times in on ball situations … Got beat off the dribble too often for someone with his physical traits …  ",6-6,200,SG,Tennessee,Sr.,2015
JP Tokoto,": An elite athlete, Tokoto has the athleticism and length, 6’10"" wingspan and 40 inch max very at the Combine, to make an impact in the league from day one … However, that’s about where his NBA level skill ends … Developed into a very good passer over his career at UNC, Roy Williams said he was the team’s best passer last season … Was tasked with covering the opposing team’s best perimeter player, which is no laughing matter during ACC play … On the ball defense will be Tokoto’s calling card early in his career … His length allows him to apply pressure on the dribbler and lets him be active in passing lanes … Though he has trouble with screens both on and away from the ball due to his slight frame …. Rebounding is another area where Tokoto’s athleticism comes into play … His ability to get off the ground quickly on both his first and second jumps means he’s constantly around the ball … Tokoto isn’t a great ball handler, but showed the ability to grab a rebound and then initiate the fastbreak … The final area where Tokoto shines is in transition … His combination of length, speed and athleticism make him a consistent threat to finish the break … His attacks to the basket often ended above the rim … If he wasn’t finishing he often made the right play whether it was an outlet pass or finding the open man … Very good at moving off the ball and finding lanes to cut through … ",": Jump shot needs major work, needs to rework his entire form from feet to release … Shot an abysmal 54 percent from the free throw line over three years … It was even more ghastly from deep, where he shot 26 percent for his career … Needs to become better attacking the basket from the left side of the floor, very right-hand dominant … Has to get more comfortable creating his own shot … Committed the fourth-most turnovers (86) in conference play las season … Had a tendency to play in spurts, must become more consistent in his overall play … Should lock himself in the weight room during his rookie season as he is to thin, weighed 196 lbs at 2015 Draft Combine to become the supreme defender that he has the skills to be … Settled too often for midrange jumpers … Fell too often for pump fakes, especially on players that weren’t great shooters … ",6-6,195,SG/SF,North Carolina,Jr.,2015
Travis Trice,": Coming off a strong NCAA Tournament performance, Trice excels due to his quickness, shooting, vision, ball handling, and crafty scoring ability … Uses his speed off the dribble to get inside and either finish at the rim over bigger defenders or kick the ball out to open teammates behind the arc. Great at ""switching gears"" and stopping and starting with the ball in his hands … Very dependable point guard. Averaged 5.2 assists per game this season, good for second in the Big Ten, and led the conference with a 3.03 assist/turnover ratio … Especially good vision in transition, and could be very successful leading the break in the faster-paced NBA game … Great perimeter shooter. Connected on 37% of his 3’s this season, and connected on over 40% in each of his first three seasons as he shot a lower volume of 3’s … Very tight handles. Allows him to be aggressive and get past defenders without turning the ball over often …Very smart and savvy player. Does a lot of little things to make a difference … Comes from a basketball family, with a coach as a father, and it shows … Creative finisher inside. Able to get a shot up over or around significantly taller players in the post to finish on his drives … Solid on-ball defender, particularly for his size … His lateral quickness serves him well guarding the perimeter … Peaked late in season, averaging 19 PPG in the Spartans run to the Final Four, which was definitely sparked by Trice … Extremely tough kid and a hard worker. Overcame severe illness and injury over the course of his college career … Good leader. Appeared to be the heart and soul of Michigan State’s team this season by the end of the year … ",": Defense is the area of Trice’s game which causes the most concern for his transition to the league …. Nearly all of Trice’s shortcomings can be traced back to the fact that he is undersized. Listed at 6’0"" and 170 lbs. (might be bigger), Trice doesn’t appear to be long or strong enough to effectively defend NBA point guards and get inside against NBA post players … His ability to take over a game, something he has displayed at both the high school and college level, will certainly be limited against NBA size and speed … His shooting numbers dropped a bit this year. His three-point percentage dropped to a career-low 37% this season, after Trice’s shooting volume increased dramatically, and his field goal percentage dropped from 42% his junior year to a pedestrian 40% for his senior year … His finishing ability and shot selection have increased dramatically since his freshman year, as evidenced by the rise in his two-point percentage from 35% (22% as a sophomore) to 43%, but he still can be troubled when finishing against size … His skill and savvy can only do so much for him against a large front line …  ",6-1,170,PG,Michigan St.,Sr.,2015
Pat Connaughton,": Excellent athlete who posted the best or tied-for-the-best numbers at the combine in the standing vert, max vert, lane agility drill, and 3/4 court sprint.  His 44-inch max vertical was, in fact, one of the best max vets in the history of the combine (but it was likely actually a 40′ inch vert, and his 37′ inch standing likely 33′ as he measured with a 4 inches taller standing reach in PIT than in Chicago, and his standing reach and other measurements, height and wingspan just do not add up)  … Sharpshooter who connected on 42% of his threes (which he took a lot of) last season.  Has a picture-perfect form.  One of the best shooters in this draft … Was sort of an elite role player in college, which will allow him to potentially make a very smooth transition to being a solid role player in the NBA.  Did a lot of little things at a high level … Smart basketball player, whether it’s helping the offensive flow on offense or always being well-positioned on defense … Crafty scorer who uses his leaping ability and solid length to finish at the rim … Really good rebounding guard. Very good leaper with great instincts for meeting the ball in the air.  Averaged over 7 rebounds per game last season … Smart and willing passer and cutter who really helps keep the offense flowing … Scrappy player who positions himself well on D and gets a lot of interceptions while still playing sound, fundamental defense…Solid wingspan (6’9"") and strong frame also help to make him a decent perimeter defender … Understandably good dunker who finishes well in transition … Had a good showing at the Portsmouth Invitational, doing a lot of quintessential role player things while shooting the ball well and getting a fair helping of points …  ",": Potential liability on defense, as he lacks the lateral quickness to do a great job at defending shooting guards but certainly doesn’t have the size to play small forward … Not a particularly threatening scorer in iso situations.  Not much of a ballhandler … Didn’t standout in terms of production in college so he may not be able to make much of an impact in the pros … Has repeatedly stated his commitment to his basketball career, but there may still be concerns about how his baseball career may take precedence … ",6-5,215,SG,Notre Dame,Sr.,2015
Anthony Brown,": Brown is a very good perimeter shooter … He is at his best when offered the chance to serve as a spot up shooter … Does a good job of making sure his body is square to the basket on every shot … Uses his shot to effectively set up himself up on pump fakes … Not the quickest player, but covers a lot of space with his long strides … Has range that extends to the NBA three point line … Very good at spacing the floor … Has a good sense of where to spot up so his teammates can find him … Effective coming off of screens as well … Defensively he often begins plays out in the proper positioning whether on or off the ball … Does of good job of not getting caught on screens … Attacks the ball well on the defensive glass … Not afraid to put his body on an opposing player … Moved the ball quickly up the court in transition either through the pass or off the dribble … Makes good decisions in the open court … Finished when running the wings whether it’s at the rim or from behind the arc … Above average free throw shooter … Has the ability to use either hand when dribbling … Can also finish with both hands at the basket …  ",": As a passer Brown doesn’t make quick enough reads when surveying the floor … Needs to get better at finding the open teammate after defense rotates to him … Has trouble finishing over length and taller opponents … Avoids contact too often in the paint … For as good of a shooter that he is, he’s inconsistent when asked to shoot off the dribble … Below average defender compared to what some may believe … Not good at being agile and lacks the lateral movement to cover in short distances … Slow when reacting to the player he’s defending change of directions … Needs to get better at fighting over screens when defending on the ball … Loses focus defensively the longer a possession goes … Over helps too much on players in the lane when guarding off the ball … Not quick enough to close out if he leaves his man open on the perimeter … Not much of a factor on the offensive glass due to the number of jump shots he takes … Will rather pull the ball back out than attempt a put-back shot …  ",6-7,210,SG/SF,Stanford,Sr.,2015
Arturas Gudaitis,": While not overly tall at 6’10’’, Gudaitis’ impressively wide shoulders and sturdy frame make him stand out from the other players whenever he’s on the floor. Knows his role and always plays within himself, which has led to terrific efficiency: 73.2% from the field and just 12 turnovers in 19 games so far this season in the Euroleague.  Strong offensive rebounder with good touch around the basket. Can score in the post with a hook shot or close-range jumper if he establishes good position before getting the ball. Can make a midrange jumper but almost never attempts them (3-5 on the year). Makes 70% of his free throws. ",": Not athletic by NBA standards … Has gotten bigger and stronger but seems to have lost some of his quickness … Virtually never puts the ball on the floor or tries to make a play for his teammates (has 3 assists in 19 games). During the 2017 Eurocup with the Lithuanian national team, Gudaitis had more freedom to create with the ball and really struggled, forcing shots and turning the ball over on passes that had no chance to get through. On defense is just an average defensive rebounder, as he sometimes struggles to box out opponents’ big men, which is inexcusable with his size and strength. Not much of a rim protector, sometimes jumps for pump fakes but is getting better in that area. NBA ",6-10,255,C,Lithuania,Intl.,2015
Brandon Ashley,": Long forward with great fluidity and touch from midrange … The wingspan gods were very generous with Ashley … Even though he’s short for a power forward at 6’8"" his 7’3.25"" wingspan allows him to play bigger than he stands … This shows most in his ability to be a presence on the boards … He was at his best on the defensive boards, which will be crucial if he wants to remain a power forward in the NBA … With the NBA venturing further and further into small ball and position less basketball, Ashley has a shot to find a niche … Offensively he has a great face up post game … Capable of putting the ball on the floor and knocking down a jump shot out to 17 feet effortlessly … Along with his productivity in the mid range area, Ashley is a better than average free throw shooter as he made 72 percent for his career at Arizona … Is very good running the floor and in transition … Has worked well with other talented players in college, should have no problem adjusting to a role in the NBA … Not an explosive athlete but is very quick for his size … Has developed good footwork and uses an array of fakes on the low block … Ashley also possesses broad shoulders that suggest he should be capable of filling out his body and improving on his strength once part of an NBA workout program … ",": Does not have the strength to battle with most NBA big men … Really needs to fill out his body and quickly … Despite an outstanding wingspan, he struggled to score against bigger defenders, both in terms of height and weight … Also, wasn’t as impactful on the defensive end … Was barely a presence in the paint on the defensive end … Often got lost or was late to rotate as the help defender … Doesn’t have one skill that he is great at … Very poor offensive rebounder … Rebounding never reached the numbers most would’ve expected from Ashley … Too dependent on his jump shot at times … Settled for contested jumpers instead of taking his defender into the paint … Seemed stuck in between becoming a perimeter based player and developing a post game … Needs to figure out what type of forward he wants to be …  ",6-8,230,PF,Arizona,Jr.,2015

Isaiah Cousins,": Already an intriguing prospect, Cousins has shown even more versatility as a senior since sliding over to the point guard position for Oklahoma … Despite not playing the point since high school, Cousins has shown a good grasp of running a pick and roll, as well as setting up one of the premier scorers in the country … He’s dishing out a career high 4.6 assists and doing so with a 2.0 assist to turnover ratio … His A/TO ratio actually increased dramatically since transitioning from an off ball player … In Lon Kruger’s high tempo offense, he’s grown used to pushing the ball, which will suit him better in the NBA than many slower paced college offenses … He’s shown the ability to get into the lane and make good decisions whether it’s finishing with a floater, getting to the hoop, or kicking it out to a teammate on the perimeter … Cousins has a good fundamental understanding of how to run an offense, and is versatile enough to be perceived as a threat off the drive and on the perimeter … Speaking of the perimeter, Isaiah is also a very capable long range shooter who’s hit 125-260 thee pointers in his junior and senior seasons in Norman combined (43%). That kind of volume and consistency will serve him well at the next level … As an NBA combo guard, who will most likely line up at the PG spot, Isaiah has a 6’5.5’’ wingspan and sizes up at 6’3’’ in shoes … While quite undersized for a two, his senior year showcasing his skills at the point has opened up more possibilities for him at the next level … For an NBA point guard he’s slightly above average in terms of size … This also allows him to rebound well for a player of his stature (4.6 per game). ",": Isaiah can sometimes struggle in terms of shot selection, especially when creating for himself off the dribble … Going into Oklahoma’s Final 4 matchup versus Villanova, Cousins is shooting just .413% from the field, which is actually below his 3 point clip … A shaky shot selection, and tendencies to over penetrate and take a bad shot over length are a part of this issue … He’s also a surprisingly sub par free throw shooter (67%) … While a pretty well built 195 pounds, he could stand to gain some more strength to adapt defensively in the NBA … He has the size, and athletic ability to guard the point guard position, but continued work in the weight room will be a must …  ",6-4,190,PG/SG,Oklahoma,Sr.,2016

His post efficiency numbers are solid, but the level of competition wasn’t great and he doesn’t show a whole lot of variety on the block. Could stand to add a few go to post moves, aside from his hook … Body appears a little bit rigid. Plays very up right, particularly on the defensive end … Turned 22 in January so upside isn’t considered as intriguing as underclassmen … Has a very solid frame for a 225 lb player, but could stand to add some weight … Not much of a shot blocker or rim protector, considering his length and athleticism … Could further develop his ball handling skills to compliment his midrange shot …  ",6-9,225,PF,Weber St.,Sr.,2016

Summary: In terms of being an NBA player, Zhou Qi’s defensive abilities should carry over … He is currently not a scoring option on the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, and would also just be a finisher at the rim or spot up shooter in the NBA, but does have offensive skills … Right now obviously his limitations are physical as he will have a lot of trouble with stronger players, although he is not as soft as his thin frame suggests … Overall an interesting player with a lot of upside.

Gary Payton II,":  Late bloomer with great athletic attributes…  Payton is a jack of all trade player at Oregon State where he can play any position 1 through 4 … He has been a statistical monster on the defensive end: Averaging 3 steals 7.5 rebounds and 1.3 blocks per game as a guard … Payton, like his dad, has his hands on nearly every entry pass, has an uncanny ability to shot block as a guard without fouling, and is a game changer defensive force that opponents must game plan for … On the offensive end Payton has a quick step and takes great angles when driving to the hoop leading to nearly a 50% field goal percentage … Getting to the hole is where he is most dangerous as he is very creative and skillful in absorbing contact and finishing strong to the hole … Explosive athlete at 6”3 he has the ability to catch and finish one handed and two handed alley oops … Payton has good form and rotation on his jump shot and has a developing mid range and long distance game.  While he is an older prospect Paton’s biggest strength is his strong work ethic: his havoc causing intensity on defense and his development over the course of this season is remarkable …  He has made great strides in his development into a lead guard as early on this season he was viewed more as a 2 -3 and has become more into a 1-2 combo guard which would be required at the next level … He is the star player on one of the surprise teams in the NCAAs as Oregon State was thought to be the doormat of the Pac 12 in preseason rankings and will be at worst NIT Bound … ",": As mentioned,  Payton is older than most of his competition at 22 years old having spent a prep season in Arizona limiting his potential upside for most analytics … To complicate things as a late bloomer he has limited experience playing at the elite level.  Furthermore his time spent in Utah Junior college has limited his exposure to scouts and to competition… Thus putting greater risk on an organization to see him perform at a consistent level…He needs to work on his ability to set teammates up and running a team averaging over 2 turnovers per game to only 3 assist per game …  Handles could be honed some in particular his left… His outside shooting is his biggest weakness… While rotation and release is clean on his shot his release speed and arc could use some refining… He has improved his free throw shooting from the JC by 15% but still is only at 67% for the season at Oregon State and is under 30% from 3 point range… ",6-3,185,PG/SG,Oregon St.,Sr.,2016

Not the most fluid player running the floor and doesn’t get great lift … Not a great rebounder (7.7 in 34 minutes per game) … Not a rim protector or much of a defensive presence at the rim … Lazy in his stance.

Kahlil Felder,": Hugely athletic small lefty guard with explosive scoring ability and court vision … Scored 20 points or over in 30 out of 35 games during his junior season at Oakland, finished 4th in the nation in scoring at 24.2 ppg … Led the nation in assists per game at 9.3 apg, was 1.2 apg ahead of player who finished next … Had some marquee performances against major conference foes, with 37 points in a double OT loss to Michigan St., 30 points in a loss to Virginia, a team known for its defense and 38 points in a win at Washington … Very good in the open floor, excels in a fast game … Very difficult to defend one-on-one, has some major quickness and blow by ability if you play him too close … Improved in efficiency every year in college, FG% increased a couple percentage points every season … Also became more competent at using the pick-and-roll, always had the ball in his hands quite a bit, but became a lot more patient and excelled in leadership role … Has ability to defend full court and is a bothersome on-ball defender, which is crucial for smaller guards at the NBA level … Was a star of the NBA Draft combine, and while his vertical is likely closer to 41”-42” or so as opposed to the 44” he measured at the combine (measured taller-longer than Nate Robinson, though with 3 inches less standing reach?), still an elite athlete by even NBA standards with some explosive ability, quickness … Averaged 2 spg, with ball pressure and passing lanes both being things he can effect when on the floor … Showed he is a big time competitor, was one of the surprises of the NBA Draft combine scrimmages, went toe-to-toe with big time NCAA PG’s … Jump shot improved, became a better long range shooter each year and improved shot selection … Strong for a small guard, gets vert low and is not an easy person to just bowl over or get position on … Had a 2.7:1 assist-to-turnover ratio, much improved from the year previous … The role of quick guard who can create offense has become valuable, which definitely seems to be a role he can fill … Got to the line at over 8 times per game, shooting near 85% FT as well, was incredibly aggressive driving to the basket … Played huge minutes in college, showed a great level of conditioning and of course gained valuable experience ",": Size will still absolutely be an issue, as much as people point to the success of Isaiah Thomas, their have been countless other small guards relegated to far lesser roles or who have had a difficult time getting rotation minutes … People will also point to his playing in a smaller conference, with a lack of great team success as well … Clearly would have been able to play at a high major school, though of course one would wonder whether he would make close to the same impact … Had trouble finishing consistently in traffic, it will be that much more difficult at the next level … While he is tough on defense, his size will cause him to be a target and will need to prove he can defend shooters or if they will just have an easy target to shoot over … Jump shot still inconsistent, not a knockdown outside shooter and it is unknown how consistent he will be from NBA range … Still did turn the ball over quite a bit and the speed of the NBA game will require him to make better decisions … Had the ball in his hands so often, it will be interesting to see how he adjusts to playing more off of the ball … As great as he is athletically, will have a huge adjustment to going up against NBA level defenders at the PG position … Can definitely work on going to his left and developing the right to left cross … Has to know his spots as a shooter, improve his spot-up game … Did very little off-screens, which will probably continue in NBA, though if he could work better playing off the ball, has speed to make himself an issue ",5-9,175,PG,Oakland,Jr.,2016
Petr Cornelie,": Intriguing size/mobility combination, long arms and legs with remarkable smoothness and quickness in running the floor … He’s really explosive, with a good vertical with solid intimidation and defensive skills, thanks to his timing and instincts … What impresses most about him is his great stamina, and energy showing a blue collar attitude to hustle on both ends of the floor … Most of his points come from second chance opportunities, put backs and offensive rebounds … Furthermore he has shown intriguing potential since he’s also able to hit outside the painted area in spot up situations, with an impressive range (more than 40% from 3 points thus far in the season in ProA) … In a modern basketball era seeking mobility and versatility he could become a valued asset … ",": While a good athlete with size, his skill level and feel for the game are very raw … He’s still skinny and could struggle to battle in the paint … His game is mainly based on facing/crashing the basket, lacking any real post moves … His thin frame sometimes leads to loss of balance when the level of physicality increases … Raw potential, his game is really energetic and instinctive, but he has to polish his skillset, work on fundamentals, positioning and decision making skills … He has to work on the controlled phase of the game, learning how to optimize spacing and timing … Furthermore despite showing intriguing potential his shot needs to add consistency, working on mechanics and to improve from the free throw line (less than 70% thus far in French ProA) … ",6-11,210,PF/C,France,Intl.,2016

Zach Auguste,": A big, strong, athletic big man prospect, who has a smoothness to his game … Superb athleticism and surprising ball handling ability and footwork make Auguste a deft face-up power forward prospect … He punishes the rim with his dunks, and he’s been known to attack the rim from all the way on the perimeter as well as take the ball up the floor himself on the fast break … His athleticism and tenacity also make him a very good rebounder, as he averaged over 10 boards a game last season…Shot a whopping 56% from the field last season…Great at getting putbacks and tip-ins around the rim…Shows soft hands catching entry passes and finishing alley-oops.  Excellent pick-and-roll player…Good at coming over from the weak side to block shots … ",": Very limited offensively.  He can get to the basket and he can finish above the rim, but he has very few post moves, nor does he have any kind of range on his jumper … Might be more inclined to play center, but at 6’10"", he doesn’t have the size to do so, and as is, may get pushed off the block at times guarding NBA 4’s … This could very well be indicative of an inability to make the transition to matching up with NBA bigs, as his athleticism and decent size won’t be nearly as big of an advantage … Statistically, Auguste is a good rebounder, but that skill may not translate as well as NBA defenders may have a much easier time boxing him out … Often plays too passively on the offensive end, although he made an impact much more consistently this past season…Not a particularly sound defender, either in the post, or on the perimeter…Will turn 23 in July, which is very undesirable for a man his size… ",6-10,240,PF,Notre Dame,Sr.,2016
Wayne Selden,": After two average seasons of collegiate basketball, Wayne Selden Jr. finally put together the kind of year many had believed he was capable of since he came out of high school. Wayne began to use his NBA positional size, which includes a 6’10’’ wingspan and a well-muscled 230 pound frame to finish at the rim. Selden shot a very impressive 71.3% at the rim (according to Hoop-Math.com) and many of his finishes were jaw dropping dunks while taking contact from defenders. As a sophomore, Wayne’s at the rim FG% was just 50%, so this massive jump was more of a mindset change, than any massive physical improvement. He also showcased more consistency on his jump shot, especially from deep where he shot .392% from 3 point range on 5 attempts per game. Selden has the size, and athletic ability to get his shot off at the NBA level, so this added consistency from deep will bode well on his next level roll. He’s also shown the ability to hit rhythm jumpers off the dribble from the mid-range, especially at the top of the key. While not a point guard, Selden is also a creative passer, and above average ball handler for a shooting guard. His 100 assists as a junior was a career high. Selden has the ability and desire to guard shooting guards and small forwards in the NBA. While he may struggle a little bit with lateral quickness on defense in the NBA, he’s extremely strong, and projects to be a capable defender at the next level. Wayne has also shown a lot of fire as a competitor, and showcased the ability to use his athleticism and size to make plays out of loose ball opportunities. Going hand in hand with his competitiveness, his highlight play ability often changed the game’s momentum and was also something that provided great value for the Jayhawks last season ",": Wayne’s most glaring weakness is his lack of free throw shooting. While his aggression as a slasher was a huge improvement, his 61% free throw clip left a lot of points on the board. His mechanics are not anything to fret over, but this block at the foul stripe seems to be more of a mental block than anything. Selden is a tremendous athlete with strength, end to end speed, and leaping ability; however, his lateral quickness isn’t quite up to par with the rest of his athletic package. His large wingspan and ability to body up can make up for this, but it may cause him some issues defending at the next level. While he did show great improvement as a junior, he’ll still need to hone is all around game to find playing time in the NBA. His foundation is there, and now that he’s finishing at the hoop and hitting a higher clip of 3 pointers, he’s got NBA value, he’s just going to need to continue to work to get major minutes on an NBA roster.

AJ Hammons,": Well-developed post-game for a prospect.  One of the best post scorers in college basketball this season.  Has a great sense of angles and a great feel for using his body to maneuver around his defender and get to the basket.  Also shows deft touch around the rim and can sink jump hooks and turnaround jumpers from out to 8 feet with regularity… Great size, standing at 7’0"" with a strong 250 lb. frame, Hammons is hard to move in the post … Solid athlete at his size, can get up and down the floor in transition, which leads to a lot of put back baskets and blocked shots … Very good post defender.  Led the Big Ten in blocks all 4 years of his Purdue career.  Has great timing, wingspan (7’3"") and leaping ability and knows how to go straight up and generally avoid significant foul trouble … Has expanded his shooting range while at Purdue.  Fairly dangerous from all the way out to 18 feet, and even connected on 6/11 three-pointers last season … Top 5 in the Big Ten in both offensive and defensive rebounding, despite only playing 24 minutes per game.  He ended up 3rd in the conference in rebounding rate … Has proven himself to be a hard worker, dramatically reshaping his body since his freshman year, becoming leaner and improving his conditioning … Has 4 years of high-level college experience, playing significant minutes in each of those years, so he will come in and be a fairly pro-ready rookie … ",": Though not so much his senior year, Hammons can often disappear for stretches of the game, not asserting himself like he’s capable of doing … His advanced age (will be 24 in August) is one of his greatest limitations, as he is already a mostly-developed player and as a big man, will have a shortened window of prime basketball once he gets to the NBA … Not the most aware passer.  Would draw double- and triple-teams in the post last season and not be able to create much out of it from a passing standpoint…Still needs to continue to clean up his turnovers. Prone to getting stripped when he brings the ball down to his waist, and also has a tendency to make poor passes out of the post … Mild off-the-court issues that caused him to be suspended for 6 games in his career, including the first 3 games of his senior season, could be a red flag … Spent a fair amount of time in Coach Painter’s dog house and occasionally lost his starting spot to Isaac Haas the past two years … Puts up good rebounding numbers, but still lacks great technique to box out competition of equal size … Got outrebounded regularly on the defensive glass by freshman teammate Caleb Swanigan … ",7-0,260,C,Purdue,Sr.,2016
Georges Niang,": Niang is an incredibly skilled and versatile player with great basketball IQ and feel for the game … His scoring efficiency jumps off the page.  He shot 54% from the field last season, including 39% from 3 and 61% from 2.  He seldom takes a bad shot, and he knows how to convert from all distances … Has a strong frame and a decent array of post moves, which allows him to play the 4, but he also has a good shooting stroke (shot 39% from 3) that allows him to play outside and stretch the defense … His excellent body control and strength allow him to both finesse and bulldoze his way to the rim despite his lack of speed … Was a huge part of the offense at Iowa State and just manages to do a bunch of little things to keep the offense flowing.  He’s an outstanding passer for his size and he also sets screens which opens up the pick-and-roll and pick-and-pop for him … Fundamentally sound rebounder who is hard to push off the block … Has the size and strength to hold his own defending NBA post players, but also is surprisingly competent as a perimeter defender … Great FT shooter at 81% … Uses a variety of ball fakes to score in the post, get past his defender, and shift the defense to create open looks for himself and for his teammates … A hard worker and an excellent leader, Niang is everything a franchise could want from a mental/leadership standpoint … ",": A tweener, Niang lacks the quickness to guard and get past NBA 3’s, and isn’t long enough to overcome the size disadvantage he’ll have against most NBA 4’s … 6-10 wingspan and 8-7 standing reach are very small for a power forward, and just average for a small forward … Has a soft body that could use better muscle tone, 10% body fat … Physically, Niang just isn’t on the level of most more perimeter-oriented NBA players … Has a severe lack of explosiveness that will make him easy to lock down on the perimeter … Not a particularly great ball-handler … Doesn’t have the length or athleticism to be a consistent rebounder at the pro level … Has good experience but also is an older player with not a lot of upside left to develop, turning 23 today, June 17th …   ",6-8,230,SF/PF,Iowa St.,Sr.,2016
Derrick White,": White has good size for a lead guard at 6’5” with a 6’8” wingspan and is comfortable playing either guard spot. His size allows him to see over the top of most defenders where he can utilize his passing ability and be a primary facilitator in an offense … White always plays with his head up in transition and is able to recognize passing lanes by seeing over the top of the defense with his size … He is willing passer that plays with good patience, and he does a good job of finding big men ducking in from the post area or kicking out to shooters off the drive or from the perimeter … His size, combined with good elevation also allows him to pull up in the mid range area over longer defenders … Although he is not a great athlete, his combination of size and length allows him to finish above the rim in space with ease … As a defender he is disruptive with his length, does a good job of getting in passing lanes to force turnovers, and contest shots … White’s greatest strength is most likely his versatility as a scorer … In his lone season for Colorado he averaged 22.3 points per 40 minutes on 57% shooting from two point range and 40% shooting from three, showing the ability to fill it up from all three levels … He has excellent instincts and plays with great pace and skill … White excels at scoring out of the pick and roll, where he can pull up off the dribble or finish with craftiness at the rim … He has a particularly advanced floater game, which he can use off of one foot or two feet with soft touch … White can finish with either hand and has excellent body control when going to the rim … He is also a quite capable spot up shooter, which allows him to be effective off the ball, and he can fire away coming off of screens … He does an exemplary job of getting his feet under him, having good balance, and exhibiting a quick release … White also gets to the free throw line frequently, where he converts at an excellent 81% … He does a great job of reading the defense off of the pick and roll, where he can turn the corner if the defense goes over the screen or make the defense pay with his jumper for going under … He gets great elevation on his mid range pull up jumper with crisp footwork before the shot … He also takes advantage of switches in the pick and roll by frequently using hesitation dribbles and changing direction to keep the bigger defender off balance … White attacks closeouts very well with jab steps, shot fakes, and step backs to separate into his pull up jumper … Another strong selling point of his repertoire is his advanced feel for the game on both ends of the court … He consistently stays poised under pressure and has the requisite vision to initiate the offense … He also has solid defensive instincts, anticipating plays well and forcing ball handlers to make counter moves … Out of the pick and roll, he uses the entire width of the floor and has excellent timing with his passes … He also can hit both the roll man and shooters on the perimeter from various passing angles … What really stands out in this area is the fact that he keeps his dribble alive and stays clam when the defense hedges hard on the ball screen, allowing him to continue the offensive flow … He also has good awareness defensively when locked in and understands where to be on the court at all times … His best attribute defensively is his ability to slide his feet and stay in front of a ball handler without using his hands … He does a textbook job of preventing straight line drives and forcing his man to change directions … Many scouts also believe that because White is a late bloomer, there is still plenty of room for him to continue developing … He is a Division-2 transfer from University of Colorado – Colorado Springs, and his frame may not be entirely filled out yet …  ",": White may still have some untapped athletic potential, but at this stage he does not have great burst or shiftiness, which may limit his ability to get to the rim or stay in front of quicker guards at the NBA level … He can be too upright at times both when turning the corner on offense and when guarding his man, limiting his explosiveness … He also may struggle to get all the way to the rim and finish over the top of NBA length … He has only an average first step from a triple threat position, making it challenging for him to turn the corner easily … His lack of burst also does not allow him to play slow to fast at a high level, as he is unable to change gears with much force … Even against big men in the pick and roll, he is not always able to turn the corner and is often forced to settle for off balance jumpers … Against teams above .500, he shot 50% from two-point range compared to over 60% against teams under .500, leaving numerous questions about if he can create offense against better competition … Despite solid athleticism combine numbers, (36.5 max vert) he is generally a below the rim player in traffic, and he will have to rely on floaters mostly, but he has shown great ability in this area … White also has an easygoing demeanor on the court and can get a bit casual at times … He needs to be a bit more vocal, especially if he is going to play a lead guard role in the NBA … He also needs to cut down on the careless turnovers and play with more consistent urgency on defense … He has a tendency to telegraph simple passes, leading to several avoidable turnovers … He also will settle for too many difficult, contested pull-ups on offense at times … On defense he will take plays off; instead of getting low in his stance and being committed to stopping his man by sliding his feet he will reach a bit too often … His defensive versatility in the NBA is also a big question mark … On the one hand, he may not have the frame to guard bigger two guards and wings, but he also may not be quick enough to guard explosive NBA point guards.

Wesley Iwundu,": After spending four seasons at Kansas State, Wes Iwundu has developed into a very versatile, two way wing capable of playing both the two and three spot in the NBA … Wes stands about 6’7’’, and possesses an excellent 7’ wingspan, and an equally impressive 8’8.5’’ standing reach … He came into college extremely lanky, and while still not a bruiser, he’s filled out nicely, and weighs in at a defined 205 pounds … In addition, he’s a high level athlete with both quickness, and leaping ability at his disposal … These physical traits, and playing in a defensive oriented system has allowed him to develop and excel as a defender … At the next level, he looks to have what it takes to be quite effective defending the 2, and while perhaps overmatched physically at the 3, he will have the versatility to switch and at least be capable defending a good portion of NBA small forwards … Iwundu is also a good positional defensive rebounder (5.3 defensive per game, and 6.4 total) and paired with his ball handling ability, he’s quite effective cleaning up defensive misses and pushing the ball in transition … Regarding his ball handling, he’s very good, especially at changing pace, and utilizing a quick first step … Wes often plays the role of a primary distributor for the Wildcats, and dishes out an impressive 3.5 assists per game … From a scoring standpoint, he’s definitely a drive and transition threat first, but has improved as a shooter over the years … He was once a poor free throw shooter, but has risen his clip at the charity stripe to a respectable .758% … While he projects as a complimentary offensive player in the NBA, he’s carried a large offensive burden for K-State and is currently averaging 12.9 points per game in a low scoring system … Iwundu does a little bit of everything, and has often come up big when his team needs him most … His versatility has allowed him to consistently flirt with triple double lines while playing excellent defense … This ability gives him appeal as a role player in the NBA because he can effect the game in many ways without being a primary focus on offense … ",": While Wes has improved a shooter, he’s still not particularly a good jump shooter … He’s always been a low volume three point shooter, and while sporting a nice 36% split as a senior, he’s attempting just 2.4 attempts per game (the first time in his career he’s averaged more than .9 attempts per contest.) … While this shows improvement, the longer line projects as an adjustment that will likely take Iwundu time to become adept shooting from that distance … He’s also just a 36.7% shooter on his two point jumpers (hoop-math.com) which is barely better than he is from beyond the arc … His damage is primary done in transition and driving to the hoop, so this may limit his offensive effectiveness in the NBA … He’ll likely not be a focal point on offense at the next level, but for a player like him, the corner three will be a necessary part of his game to improve … At this point his upside is fairly limited as well … Even four year players improve when they make the jump to the professional ranks, but Wes doesn’t have a major NBA calling card … He’s projects to be a plus defender at the two spot, but he’s still going to be overmatched by many NBA small forwards, and he doesn’t fill the role of a player who can fill it up off the bench in the scoring column … He’s good at everything, but not great at one thing … That can often be the difference between a long term NBA career, or one that results in playing overseas after a year or two as a low minute reserve …  ",6-7,195,SG/SF,Kansas State,Sr.,2017
Tyler Lydon,": Stretch 4 with a pretty stroke from the perimeter … Gets good lift with a high release point and a smooth follow through … Good athlete with solid leaping ability off two feet … Should have no trouble extending his range out to NBA three, and be a weapon at the next level … Very good pull up shooter from midrange with a clean, concise shooting form … Displays solid post footwork offensively … Has a nice righty jump hook in his repertoire … Crafty at using pump fakes to get defenders off balance … Attacks closeouts well using quick feet to get by defenders off the dribble … Today’s shift to bigs that can spread the floor and shoot adds intrigue to his game … Big 7′ wingspan helps him to get shots off and bolsters his ability on the boards … A solid passer who often facilitated the offense from the high post … Despite a thin frame, showed nice aggressiveness on the glass putting up 8.6 rpg … gets a lot of tip ins due to his great length … 36 minutes per game shows that he’s well conditioned, made easier in the Syracuse system … Hit a near identical (49/124) from three as a sophomore as he did as a freshman (49/121) roughly 40% … Improved FT shooting from FR to SO Years from 77% to 84% … Good vision and passing ability for a big … Positive a/to ratio at 2.1/1.7, solid for a forward … Shot blocking dipped from 1.8 to 1.4 from freshman year, but illustrates his length giving opponents problems … Could log some minutes at the 3 if a team decides to go big, provided his perimeter defense isn’t atrocious … May always struggle to put on weight and play physical …  ",": Comes into the league with limited conventional defensive ability, after playing in Jim Boeheim’s 2-3 zone for the past two years … D is a big question mark … Frail body for a 4. Needs to add weight to battle inside for rebounds and defend … Added strength will allow him to play physical and get more trips to the line … Toughness and ability to hold position in the post remain question marks … Can be careless at times with his passing … lack of significant improvement a bit puzzling. For such a strong offensive talent, it would have been nice to see him take over a little more offensively … 13.2 ppg and offensive numbers and output eerily similar to freshman season begs the question if he has the desire to be a star or will be content as a role player at the next level … fairly one dimensional player as his outside shooting and length gives him a lot of intrigue but his lack of strength makes him a bit of a project … 13% body fat at 215 lbs is slightly concerning. He not only is too weak from a weight standpoint, he’s not nearly as cut as he needs to be, so conditioning and adding good weight will be imparitive …  ",6-9,215,PF,Syracuse,So.,2017
Frank Mason,": One of the most prolific players in all of college basketball, despite his size, brings many NBA translatable skills to the table … First of all, he’s immensely improved as a long range shooter in four seasons with the Jayhawks … He shot .471% his senior season, on a healthy 4.8 attempts per game … Frank can pull up off the dribble, as well as spot up from beyond the arc, and expect to hit a high percentage … His release is high and quick, which is beneficial when looking to the NBA … Mason is also very adept in using screens, and operating in the pick and roll … This will directly aid in his transition as well … While not a classic, pass first, point guard, Frank is excellent at running a team, and has a respectable 2+ assist to TO ratio, on 5.2 assists per game .. Mason’s drive and kick game is one of his strongest areas of being a set up man … His ability as a scorer is well rounded … He’s averaged 20.9 points per game, and he can get them at the rim, in the mid range, in transition, and beyond the arc … Mason is a bulldog and can use his high level athletic ability to get tough buckets, and get to the line, where he shoots .784% … Speaking of his athletic ability, he has elite quickness, and end to end speed, both with and without the ball in his hands … KU trainer Andrea Hudy has regarded him as the strongest player on the team, and this greatly aids him on the court … His body control and leaping ability are also very impressive … Despite being under 6’, Frank has converted alley-oop dunks and countless plays that require high levels of athleticism … Mason is a tough defender, who is great at getting under larger guards … His lateral quickness makes him tough to get past, and his effort is always there … It’d be easy for a player with his offensive burden to dial it back on D, but Frank’s toughness and leadership qualities shine through where he gives maximum effort at all times …  ",": Undersized at the point guard position, Frank Mason III is just 5’11’’ tall, and looks to have a wingspan just slightly longer than his height … He can do plenty of things to make up for this, but this will directly affect how he finishes around the rim in the NBA … Mason converted at about a 56% clip (hoop-math.com) at the NCAA level, but despite his body control, he’ll find it more difficult to convert at the next level … Frank can also get caught in the air without a plan … He’s much better than he was when he first hit the NCAA scene, but he still can be a tad reckless at times … He will also be easy to shoot over in the NBA … While pesky, and tough, his defensive outlook will still be affected by his stature … There’s little doubt Frank will continue to improve as a player, but at nearly 23 years old, you wonder how much upside he has left.

Jonah Bolden,": Versatile player, who – under the right conditions – can be play in all front court positions… Great size and lentgh for a power forward…. He has really long arms and a very good wingspan (measured at 7-3 feet)… Smooth athlete, with very good jumping ability off two feet when he has room to gather… Team player, who plays inside the system… High basketball I.Q… He runs the floor extremely well for a big… Really light on his feet… Impressive ball handling for a player his size… Can start the fast the break as the ball handler and do the coast to coast if he finds room… Great on transition, really knows how to fill the lanes… Stretch-4 potential… He has a nice looking shooting stroke… Can Shoot the ball well from the perimeter, going all the way up to 3-point range… His mid-range game is really solid… Excellent on Pick and Pop situations… Can Play the Pick and Roll as the screener at a very good level… Solid on creating his own shot… Has a good Pull Up Jump shot as a counter move… Can play above the rim… Likes to finish strong at the basket…. Puts the ball on the floor and attacks closeouts thanks to his athleticism and solid first step… Very good passer…. Posseses great court vision and sees angles that are rare to be seen by bigs… Moves well without the ball… Very good rebounder, who is not afraid to bang bodies… Relentless on the offensive boards, puts a lot of presure on the opposing team… Great lateral quickness… He can switch on a perimeter player while defending the Pick and Roll with ease and hold his ground…. He is a great shot blocker, with good instincts… His length, defensive instincts and above average athleticism make him a good rim protector… Covers a lot of ground on defense with his length and athleticism and contests shots… Has active hands on Defense, which helps him make a lot of steals… Very good weakside defender…  ",": He really needs to add strength, especially on his upper body… Very good, but not an elite athlete… The fact that he needs room to gather before jumping can be a problem at the next level… He might play inside the system, but this could make him look passive at times on offense… He needs to learn when to step up for his team… His free throw shooting was bad in 2016/17 season (below 60%), which is kind of bizzare considering he was shooting in the low 40’s from 3-point range… He doesn’t go to the line as often as you would expect from a guy with his skillset… Has the tendency to settle for mid-range and long range shots instead of going all the way to the basket… Has problems creating his own shot against athletic defenders… Seems to prefer to Pop out after he sets a screen rather than Roll hard to the basket…. He doesn’t establish position in the Post and can’t really exploit any miss-matches… His Post game is just average and doesn’t have enough counter moves… At times he tries to do too much with his ball in his hands, either by forcing a difficult pass or make one more dribble than he should, which leads to turnovers… There are moments he puts his hands down when he tries to block a shot and as a result he commits bad fouls… Holds his ground in the post on Defense, but he can’t really contain strong, physical players… Can lose focus on defense, and be too concern looking at the ball… ",6-10,235,PF,Australia,Intl.,2017
Cam Oliver,": An extremely explosive athlete who unleashes ferocious dunks on the rim … Oliver plays with ferocity, intensity and aggressiveness … He is a terrific rim protector, having EIGHT games this season with four or more blocks … He gets after it under the boards too, having 11 double-doubles in points and rebounds and 13 games with double digit rebounds … His scoring went up this year and he was always confident banging down low and getting to the rim … His field goal percentage at the rim was a superb 75 percent … For as good as his paint presence was, he shot just as effectively from mid-range and three … In fact, he had just about an even split between his field goal locations (mid-range and three-point shots each were about 1/3 and shots at the rim were close to 25 percent) … If there is one thing to compliment Oliver on, it’s the fact that he came back to school this year and did what so many have failed to do: improve his skills and increase his draft stock … It’s always a huge risk but he did it … His scoring went up, his shot blocking got better, he established himself as a rim protector and glass eater and he elevated his team as a leader and led them into the Big Dance (where he played very well) … Versatility is one of the most heavily valued traits by NBA teams and execs and Oliver has it … He can score in a multitude of ways, has speed to blow by defenders off the dribble and he outworks bigger players down low in the trenches … He plays above the rim with his great physical tool set and we can’t talk about Oliver without talking about the explosiveness he has at the rim … He is so aggressive and thunderous when he dunks, he is essentially assaulting the rim with bad intentions … ",": For all those positives to look at, there should be caution moving forward on him … For one, he never played elite talent … He played in the Mountain West, a mid major conference and rarely against power conference schools … He made one NCAA Tournament game and was bounced in the first round (even though he played very well) … His scoring was far too inconsistent and some scouts question his motor and desire to dominate … Some games he would go off in the high 20’s of points, and some he went cold and never cracked double digits in points … He also only shot 24 percent of his shots at the rim this past season, which isn’t bad since he was diversifying his shot selections but it wasn’t’ ideal … For a player with his size and speed attributes, one would expect him to be driving and dominating around the basket more …   Instead, he settled too often for outside jumpers and his offensive game has not become diversified … His ability to knock down 3s adds intrigue, but he hasn’t developed much of a post game … His vision has not improved in college … Too frequently he displayed tunnel vision and put his head down, failing to spot open players when he was double teamed or drove to the basket … He must improve this if he wants to be a stretch forward in the NBA … Speaking of stretch forward, what position will Oliver play? He lacks great height and bulk to be a power forward and isn;t skilled enough for small forward … Scouts have also knocked Oliver for his low basketball I.Q … Too often this was displayed on defense when he left his assignments or broke away from schemes. And even though he was a very good shot blokcer, as a small power forward, that skill doesn;t always translate …  Scouts also questioned his heart and consistency, since his senior season was marred by multiple games of very high numbers and games of very low numbers … If your passion or effort level are in question, that’s not a good sign to execs … ",6-8,240,PF,Nevada,So.,2017
Ike Anigbogu,": The intrigue with Anigbogu starts with his outstanding frame, standing at 6’10"" with great length (7′ 6.25” wingspan and 9′ 2.5” standing reach) , and a strong, (252 lbs) explosive lower body … He’s also quick on his feet, changes direction well, has a quick second jump, and brings a consistently high energy level … He offers many of the qualities of the modern energy big man that NBA teams look for today … Those physical tools provide Anigbogu with a strong base, allowing him to make an impact even though his skillset is farther behind at this stage … Anigbogu contributes in a variety of ways on the offensive end, despite an unpolished perimeter game … One of his most valuable attributes is his consistent production on the offensive glass, where he pulled down an impressive 4.1 offensive rebounds per 40 minutes … Anigbogu is active on the glass and can be an explosive athlete in space … He also has the size and lower body strength to carve out space down low … He has a quick second jump, and the physicality to absorb contact, which helps him to finish second chance opportunities … Anigbogu also moves well off the ball, especially with his mobility and ability to elevate in space … His other clear strength offensively is in transition, where he has long strides and excellent speed for a big man, allowing him to beat his man down the court regularly … He’s also an active rim runner who plays with a great motor … On the defensive end appears to be where Anigbogu will make the biggest impact, and where his long-term potential is the most obvious … He averaged 3.5 blocks per 40 minutes this past season and was a quality rim protector off the bench for UCLA … His length comes into play here, as does his ability to cover ground quickly, and he shows good timing as he takes pride in finding opportunities to alter shots … Another area where Anigbogu can impact the game defensively is in the pick and roll, a key for a big man in today’s NBA … He does a good job of stepping out on ball screens to help his guard and he has the mobility to recover and cut off a driving lane or step out and contest a perimeter shot … His technique still needs to be refined, but he has the potential to switch out on guards and stay in front of them as well … Anigbogu is also a strong post defender, with the size and strength to hold his position and the length and athleticism to contest shots … The good news for Anigbogu is that the things that he does well, such as altering shots at the rim, running in transition, being a consistent threat on the offensive glass, being a lob threat at the rim, will shape an NBA role that’s become increasingly valued at his position in today’s game … His awareness and recognition needs to continue to develop, as does his overall skill level, but given his physical gifts, motor, and youth (he won’t turn 19 until October), there will be plenty of teams around the league happy to have him come draft night … ",": Although Anigbogu has an impressive combination of physical tools, his overall skillset has a great deal of catching up to do … His touch around the basket can be a bit erratic, as most of his scoring comes off of putbacks and lob passes … He’s also not nearly as explosive of a leaper in traffic, and he doesn’t have the awareness to consistently know when to kick the ball out and reset the possession … He will often force tough shots with little to no chance of converting … This can be seen through the fact that he shot only 48% on field goal attempts after offensive rebounds  … Even though he is an explosive athlete in space, when contested by an equal athlete, his lack of touch becomes an issue … It will be important for him to improve in this area, especially considering the jump in interior talent he’ll be facing in the NBA … He could also stand to improve his hands, as he struggles to catch passes thrown below his chest … In terms of perimeter skill level, Anigbogu still has much work to do. He attempted just eight jump shots on the season, and looked very mechanical when doing so … There isn’t a whole lot of fluidity in his jump shot, and his 53.5% shooting from the free-throw line suggests that he does not have great upside as a stretch forward … Anigbogu is similarly unrefined in the post … Despite his size and strength, he shot just 30.4% on post-up opportunities, despite using a sizable portion of his half-court offense on the block … His lack of touch again comes into play here, but his unrefined footwork is a big factor in his ineffectiveness as well … Anigbogu can become predictable in the post, as he is limited to mostly simple jump hooks and turnarounds … His hands are not secure and he fumbles away far too many easy catches and rebounds … He also becomes very turnover prone when doubled in the post, turning the ball over on nearly 18% of his post-up possessions, which is nearly as often as the 25% at which he scores … Another issue he has is that he can be too aggressive in seeking out opportunities to block shots … Anigbogu has a tendency to find himself out of position as he chases shots he has little to no chance of getting to … While his constant motor and activity level are things to be valued, he’ll have to work on harnessing his aggression and continue to develop his overall recognition, awareness, and communication defensively in order to make the most of his physical gifts … His 7.6 fouls for per 40 minutes, pace adjusted, say a lot about his lack of defensive discipline … Even though it takes six fouls in the NBA before disqualification, he will need to improve in this area to stay on the court for longer stretches … One more area he could improve on is on the defensive glass, as he hauled in just 19.9% of the available defensive rebounds while he was on the court … His activity as a shot blocker hinders him somewhat in this regard, but his overall awareness can get better … He is capable of rebounding out of his area because of his physical tools, but he needs to do a better job of being in position to haul in defensive rebounds …  ",6-10,250,C,UCLA,Fr.,2017
Josh Hart,":  From an offensive standpoint, Hart improved on just about everything as a senior … He scored an impressive 18.7 points per game on a very efficient .51% from the field … He also raised his long range percentage to 40% on a healthy 5.1 attempts per game (up from 3.9 as a junior) … Mature and well rounded game … Scrappy competitor … His long range shot will be a selling point in a league that value’s spacing … He’ll make most of his NBA living spotting up … As a senior, he also got to the charity stripe a career high 4.7 times per game, and knocked them down at a respectable 75% clip … While his NBA calling card will likely be as a spacer on offense, his increased aptitude as a slasher and good finishing power at the rim will help … He’s a willing passer with a high court IQ, which helped him tally an impressive 2.9 assists per game as a senior … Hart is a very good rebounder for a guard (6.4 per game) . At 6’4’’ and  (6’8.5’’ wingspan) barefoot he’ll measure up pretty well for an NBA shooting guard, he’s a well built 205-215 pounds (204 at last year’s combine) and will be able to keep up with more guards than one’s he’s outmatched against … Hart is a competitor, and was an elite defensive guard in college … Averaged 1.6 steals per game in route to a share of the Big East’s Defensive Player of the Year award … Josh also tested pretty well as an athlete last year at the combine … A 38.5’’ max vertical was one of his more impressive stats, but he doesn’t quite fit the bill as an elite overall athlete …  He fits the prototype of a 3 and D role player in the NBA, who also increased his effectiveness as a distributor at Villanova. It should also be noted that he’s incredibly coachable and mature … Josh Hart should have little trouble transitioning to the NBA from a work ethic and maturity standpoint …  ",": While Hart is above average in terms of athletic ability, and certainly has his strengths, he’s not overly explosive … May struggle at the next level to create open looks as he lacks speed and size … Not the quickest leaper, this may catch up to him a little more against stronger competition … Lacks great size for the wing … At 22 and as a player who’s improved tremendously, his lack of perceived upside is a major factor that is preventing him from being a high pick … Defensive efficiency numbers are just average. Lack of great lateral speed limits his ability to stand out in this area … Jack of all trades, master of none type. He has rounded out his weak spots fairly well, but still doesn’t have any skill that will stand out at the next level … Hart has improved as an overall shooter, but he’s still not great operating in the mid range … As a two guard, he’s also not a high level ball handler at this point in his development … While solid, he’s not going to provide as much versatility as some in a league with increasingly interchangeable backcourts …  ",6-5,210,SG,Villanova,Sr.,2017

Seems to have lost some of the explosiveness that he displayed in high school … Not great at scoring in isolation. Lacks a great first step … May struggle some to get shots off as he lacks a quick first step and doesn’t get a ton of lift on his jump shot … Without much lift, he probably will not be as effective driving to the rim at the rim …  ",6-5,210,SG,South Carolina,Sr.,2017

Become a better ball handler … Not a smart defender … Can get in foul trouble quickly because he is not disciplined with his feet … Will try to block every shot … Can try to do too much at one time with the ball in his hands … Loses balance and shoots off balance on the low post at the time, has trouble with coordination … Not great with passing skills and court awareness on the floor …  Stevan Petrovic 6/21/17 April 5, 2013   ",6-9,235,PF,France,Intl.,2017
Tyler Dorsey,": Dorsey ended his Oregon career on fire, leading the somewhat depleted Ducks all the way to the Final Four … He finished the year with eight straight 20-plus point games, while earning the nickname “Mr. March” for his stellar play in big games … He continued his momentum into the NBA Combine, where he posted per 40 averages of 21.6 points, 8.5 rebounds, and 5.9 assists on 56% shooting from three-point range in two games … Dorsey’s play over the last few months has vaulted him into an intriguing possible second round option for any team looking to add shooting off the bench … Dorsey’s elevated draft stock begins with his outstanding scoring instincts … He shot an excellent 41% from distance in his two seasons with the Ducks and is also an excellent shooter off the dribble … While he is not an explosive athlete, he makes up for it around the rim with soft touch and craft to convert a high percentage (57.3% at the rim) of his looks inside. He does an excellent job of spotting up in transition as he has a knack for finding open spaces on the court to get his shot off, where he has deep range that should translate to the NBA arc … He gets his feet set quickly as well, and his mechanics stay consistent with a hand in his face … Dorsey also does a great job of running off screens to get his shot off and looks very comfortable shooting on the move … Off the pick and roll he consistently demonstrated the ability to make defenders pay for going under the ball screen with his pull up jumper … One also has to appreciate that he never loses confidence in his shot and that he does not need much space at all to get it off … At the rim, he uses a lot of shot fakes and has excellent footwork to get his shot off, or draw contact and get to the free throw line (75% conversion rate) … It is primarily Dorsey’s shot making and ability to get hot in a hurry that gives him great potential as a role player in the NBA … With NBA spacing he could thrive as a shot maker and secondary ball handler off the bench. Dorsey is not a true floor general, but he did play a lot of point guard for Oregon, so he has experience running an offense … He is also improving as a playmaker, as he has decent vision and does not turn the ball over that frequently … He operates well out of the pick and roll and has shown flashes of making good reads to set up his teammates … Dorsey particularly showed during the NCAA Tournament that he is unusually poised in big moments and that he can be depended on to make big plays when it counts … Any potential playoff team that may draft him would really appreciate the mental aspect of his game … If Dorsey can prove that the NCAA Tournament was not a fluke and that he is really beginning to put it all together, he could carve out a nice career for himself.  ",": The most concerning aspect of Dorsey’s game is his less than impressive physical tools for an NBA two-guard … He checked in at the NBA Combine at 6-4.5 with an even more underwhelming 6-5 wingspan … He also weighs just 183 pounds, so he may struggle to get to the rim and finish against bigger, physical guards … This will likely prevent him from being a multi-positional defender at the next level … His lack of length will limit his effectiveness to guard on the perimeter and be active in passing lanes … He has already shown limitations in this area, averaging just 1.1 steals per 40 minutes in two seasons at Oregon … With his physical profile, he is probably best suited to guard point guards, but he may not be quick enough to do so given how explosive modern-day NBA point guards are … Dorsey also does not show a great deal of competitiveness on this end of the court either … When switched onto bigger players he does not battle for position persistently … He also tends to have some frequent lapses off the ball, losing shooters on the wings or giving up easy backdoor cuts. Dorsey does not project as an advanced shot creator at the NBA level either. Given his average explosiveness and shiftiness with the ball, he can get forced into some difficult shots, and he will probably have trouble finishing around the rim against NBA length/athleticism. Much of his shot selection comes via difficult contested shots given his lack of creativity with the ball and his less than ideal physical tools. He can be out of control going to the rim as well and force a lot of wild shots at the basket instead of looking to make a play for someone else. Dorsey is not a very willing passer either, which can cause him to be inefficient at times. It appears that the majority of his NBA impact will be contingent on his shot making ability. However, if he can’t get hot from the outside, NBA teams might worry if there is anything else he can bring to the table.  ",6-4,185,SG,Oregon,So.,2017
Anzejs Pasecniks,"Analysis   NBA Comparison: Ante Tomic Strenghts: He has an impressive frame at 7-2, with a solid structure and some late developing muscular development … He has a remarkable wingspan, combined with solid mobility … With his size and mobility, he’s the ideal target in the paint area in P&R situations, both for lobs or put backs … He has a nice handle for his size, with the ability to challenge the defender off the dribble and to finish with either hand … He has also shown intriguing potential as a shooter, since he is able to hit shots from behind the three-point line in catch and shot situations … He shows flashes as a defender, both in close outs and as a rim protector, thanks to his footwork and explosiveness … His ability to shoot elevates his stock some as a player teams are looking for … Even though he will turn 22 in December, still seems to have more potential left to develop than the average draft eligible player …  ",": Despite his frame, he still needs to add some pounds of muscle and work on his physical toughness, since stronger opponents in the painted area often bounce him back … He lacks positioning and defensive fundamentals, especially in P&R, where he’s not able to properly exploit his potential yet … He’s often late on defensive switches, losing his direct opponent … Offensively he lacks solid post skills, despite having shown a nice touch and a solid hook shot with both hands … Furthermore, he has to work on his release, which is currently too slow …  ",7-1,220,C,Latvia,Intl.,2017
Damyean Dotson,": After beginning his career at Oregon, Dotson transferred to Houston and had two excellent seasons to end his college career and draw interest from around the NBA … Dotson averaged 20.3 points and 8.1 rebounds per 40 minutes and has some intriguing potential at the next level even if he is more of a project at the moment … Measured at 6-5.5 with a solid 6-9 wingspan, Dotson has a nice combination of physical tools along with some very good open court speed … Possesses very solid run/jump athleticism, and appears that he will hold his own against NBA athleticism after registering a 38-inch max vertical leap at the NBA Combine … Dotson’s best attribute, which will likely be his NBA calling card, is his catch and shoot ability … He can be lethal spotting up on the perimeter or running off of screens, where he does a terrific job of reading his defender and knowing where to cut so he can get off a clean look … Dotson gets his feet set quickly and has great elevation on his jumper … He also shot 44.3% from three-point range last season on a lofty 7.6 attempts per game and is a terrific shooter off the dribble (made 41% of his pull-up jumpers) … Dotson has also pleasantly surprised people with his passing ability in pre-draft events, after averaging just 1.1 assists per game at Houston last season … In five games at the NBA Combine and PIT, Dotson averaged 7 assists per-40 minutes … Continuing to develop his playmaking could make him a really valuable backcourt player if his jump shot turns out to be as prolific in the NBA as it was this past season … Dotson is a physical on-ball defender, which could provoke some three-and-D potential … He does a nice job of sliding his feet to contain dribble penetration, and he can force challenging shots with his length … He will need to add some strength to hold up, but he has the tools to become a solid multi-positional defender off the bench in the future … Dotson is also effective on the glass for a shooting guard, where he averaged 6.9 boards per game this past season … He has excellent motor that allows him to crash the glass from the perimeter and pursue rebounds out of his area … Mainly Dotson’s ability to knock down shots from the perimeter will have teams taking considering him in the second round, but he could become a productive player in the league if he can find a way to contribute in another area …  ",": Dotson has some solid potential on defense, but he will need to improve his strength, to hold up against bigger NBA guards and wings … Scouts also question if he will be able to bring anything else to the table offensively other than spot up shooting … Creating offense via off the dribble or in the pick and roll is not one of his strengths … Also a hefty 84.5% of his field goal attmepts were jump shots, which is not an efficient way to score in the NBA … If his jumper is not working, there is concern that he will be of almost no value when on the floor because of this high rate … In addition he got to the free throw line only 1.7 times per game last season, a testament to his heavy dose of jump shot selection … While he showed glimpses of passing ability in pre-draft workouts, he averaged a pedestrian 1.5 assists per-40 minutes in his career, so there are question marks about why he never was a high level facilitator in his college career … He also needs to make some strides on his off the ball defense … He takes poor angles when chasing cutters on the perimeter, and he has a tendency to be out of control when closing out to shooters … He is also already 23 years old, so there is not a lot of time for him to develop or prove himself in the league … He will need to establish himself relatively quickly if he wants to stick in the NBA …  ",6-6,205,SG/SF,Houston,Sr.,2017
Semi Ojeleye,": Ojeleye is a physically developed forward at 6’7” and 235 pounds with excellent versatility … He can handle the ball in the open court and make shots from the perimeter both spotting up or on the move … He is also a solid shot creator in the half-court, and he gets to the free throw line frequently by using his combination of strength and mobility … Ojeleye may be a valued later pick in this draft, as an explosive combo forward that can stretch the floor, create his own shot and be a factor defensively … Ojeleye has become an excellent stretch four-type player at SMU, something he did not have many opportunities to exhibit during the early stages of his career at Duke … He shot 42% from the arc this season while attempting almost five three-pointers per game … Ojeleye’s work ethic is top notch, as he has added multiple dimensions to his game since his time at Duke … He played mostly as a four man in SMU’s offense, so there will be few questions about where to play him in the NBA … Ojeleye can also shoot off the dribble if chased off the three-point line, as he has an effective pull-up jumper off of one or two dribbles … He is mobile enough to attack opposing fours off the dribble with his lethal combination of power and quickness … He is also dangerous as a face up post player, with an excellent face up jumper, and he has crisp footwork from down in this area … Ojeleye averaged 23.5 points per 40 minutes, while shooting 50% from two and 42% from three, showing his ability to play within himself and be efficient … Ojeleye has an NBA ready frame at 235 pounds, and at age 22 he will be ready to contribute immediately … He’s also an outstanding athlete in space with the ability to finish above the rim when he has momentum … He particularly utilizes this ability on the offensive glass, where he has terrific motor to pursue the ball, and often turn missed shots into thunderous put backs … He is not elite on the defensive glass yet, but he does a great job of using his strength to box his man out and carve out space … Ojeleye also is a very good finisher around the basket in part due to his mature frame and quality body control … He is a high IQ player, as he rarely commits turnovers and overall does an excellent job of not forcing the issue and playing to his strengths … He is an outstanding teammate and never tries to do too much … His most likely role in the NBA will be mostly as a mismatch small ball four-man, who can play on the wing occasionally … ",": Ojeleye is a bit undersized for a power forward even in today’s small ball heavy NBA at 6’7”, and he doesn’t have elite length either at 6’10” (wingspan) … Defensive fit will be a big question mark going forward as he’s not quite big enough to match up with traditional fours, and he doesn’t have a ton of experience guarding NBA-level wings, as a result of playing in the AAC … His instincts on that end have room to improve as well, evident by his low block and steal rates … Ojeleye can also be more productive on the defensive glass (just 5.5 d-boards per 40 minutes) … If he is going to play the four for long stretches in the NBA, he will need to add some improvement here … Ojeleye’s lack of elite size and average standstill leaping will hurt him as an interior scorer in the NBA, and his overall perimeter skill set could use some polish if he wants to play more minutes on the perimeter … Ojeleye is not nearly as explosive in traffic, and he is not a great ball handler for a wing player … He also does not have a great left hand, which can make it difficult to succeed in the NBA without some degree of ambidexterity … Another big question mark will be how he adjusts from the poor level of competition of the American conference this season to the NBA … He did little to squander these questions when SMU had big NCAA tournament expectations, but were bounced early by USC, a team with great size, length, and athleticism …  ",6-6,240,SF/PF,SMU,Jr.,2017
Dillon Brooks,": Brooks is coming off a spectacular junior season for the Oregon Ducks, in which he put up nearly identical numbers as the year prior despite playing an average of seven minutes fewer per contest … Brooks scored 16.1 points per game on 48.8% shooting from the field and 40.4% percent from three en route to Pac-12 Player of the Year Honors and a Final Four run … Brooks has a filled out frame at 6-6, 220 pounds that allows him to occasionally play some small-ball four … He is absolutely relentless going to the rim on straight line drives, having the ability to overpower defenders and create space with sheer physicality that also allows him to finish through contact … Brooks has excellent body control and can absorb contact at the rim without having his shot very affected. In space he can also finish above the rim with authority even when challenged at the basket, and he is good vertical athlete (37.5” max vertical) … His strength helps him out on defense as well; even though he lacks length, he uses his strength and physicality to compete for good position and contain the dribble … Brooks also has a versatile offensive skillset that Pac-12 teams had an extremely difficult time figuring out … He averaged 25.1 points per 40 minutes, which was good for second in the conference, and he is excellent isolation player … He can score from all three levels, via at the rim, in the mid range area, and from beyond the arc (40.4% on 4.1 attempts per game) … He is also a much improved playmaker, doing an especially solid job in drive and kick situations … Brooks is not just a ball dominant scorer though … He has shown the ability to play off the ball and space the floor due to his improved catch and shoot play and ability to spot up in transition … He does an excellent job of getting his feet set quickly and squaring his shoulders to the basket on his jumper … When chased off the line, he has an outstanding pull-up game … Brooks proved over the last two years that he was one of the best tough shot makers in college basketball … He has deep range and can bury contested shots off the dribble … He also is great at creating space via jab steps and step back jumpers. His ambidexterity around the basket also makes him a lot more dangerous as a scorer around the rim and really completes his offensive repertoire … Brooks also shows flashes of terrific vision (4.3 assists per 40 minutes) whether kicking out to open shooter or to big men ducking in the low post … In addition, it is difficult to ignore the advanced mental aspects of Brooks’ game … He never seems to lose confidence and clearly is not afraid of the big moment … Brooks hit multiple game-winning shots this year and was a key piece in Oregon’s Final Four run that included an upset-win over top-seeded Kansas in the Elite Eight …  ",": The biggest question at this stage with Brooks is how much his less than stellar length (6-6 wingspan) will hold him back in the NBA … Even though he has the strength to finish through contact, his lack of length impedes his ability to finish over defenders with NBA-level physical profiles … It is also uncertain whom he will be able to guard at the next level with his lack of elite length or quickness, which causes him to struggle containing quicker guards off the dribble … He was most effective guarding fours in college, but they will be much bigger and longer in the NBA … He may not be able to create offense effectively against NBA wings either, as he benefited in college from playing a lot of small-ball four … A good portion of his offense came via straight line drives, but he will not be able replicate this in the pros, and he does not have much shiftiness with the ball as a counter … When his straight line drive is taken away he does not have much change of direction skill … He does not change speed with the ball well and is really not the most advanced ball handler either … He also lacks burst from a stand still position, preventing him from turning the corner at times … He probably will not be able to rely on isolation scoring in the NBA, but much of his offense came from these types of plays … How will he fit into an NBA offense without disrupting its flow? Brooks also averaged 3.3 turnovers per 40 minutes, which is a higher number than what one would like to see from a forward … He also is not an effective rebounder at just 5.1 rebounds per 40 minutes, showing some inconsistent effort on box outs and fighting for good position … Brooks will need to show that he can bring more to the table than shot making if he wants to be a reliable rotational player in the NBA …  ",6-6,220,SF,Oregon,Jr.,2017
Sterling Brown,": Brown was a key contributor for an outstanding SMU team this season, and he has a chance to be one of the biggest sleepers in this draft … His physical tools and offensive skill give him a shot to be taken in the second round … He averaged 13.4 points per game and shot 44.9% from three as a senior, and is a 45.1% percent shooter from distance in his career … Brown also was a factor in numerous other areas, averaging 6.5 rebounds, 3.0 assists and 1.4 steals per game … Brown is a crafty, high IQ player that plays within himself, and his overall skillset points toward a valuable three and D player, which is coveted nowadays … He is an excellent catch and shoot player with good mechanics and a quick release … He also looks comfortable as a scorer in terms of being able to create his own shot and be a playmaker for others (3.0 assists per game) … He is an adept scorer off the dribble in the mid-range area, especially off of a one-dribble pull up … There is no glaring weakness to Brown’s overall offensive skillset, which will keep him on the court at the NBA level … At 6’5” with a 6’9” wingspan, Brown has the potential to be a multi-positional defender on the perimeter … He has a solid frame at 230 pounds as well, and has a solid combination of size, strength, and lateral quickness / explosiveness for an NBA two guard … He also showed he could be disruptive on the perimeter at SMU, averaging 1.4 steals per game this past season … Brown is an exceptional rebounder for a guard as well with great motor and the athleticism necessary to chase down missed shots all over the floor … Another underrated aspect of his game to look at is that he will have a very clear role in the NBA as a secondary scorer and perimeter defender, which is quite similar to his role at SMU … This kind of continuity will make the transition to the pros much easier … Overall, he is an athletic swingman that can score in a variety of ways, and he also is a good defensive player that can guard multiple positions … ​ ",": Brown does not have an elite first step off the dribble, which will prevent him from being as well-rounded of a scorer in the NBA as he showed in college … While he is a good all-around athlete, he is not elite in terms of explosiveness and does not project as an above the rim finisher in traffic … He converts at a high percentage from the free-throw line, but he does not get there very often … Most of Brown’s offense comes from behind the arc, and he has a tendency to settle for some tough two-point jumpers … The biggest question with him is that while he does not have any obvious weakness, he also has not mastered any particular area … He has shown himself to be an excellent shooter, but he is not a specialist … As long as his prolific shooting can carry over to the NBA, and he can become a consistently reliable perimeter defender, Brown will be just fine.

Alec Peters,": 4-man with a sweet shooting stroke and tremendous range … Experienced forward who was one of the most prolific scorers (23 ppg) in the country in his Senior year … One of the top overall shooters on the college level … A floor spacer who cannot be left open on the perimeter … With today’s NBA shifting over to specialty players, his one dimensional game could be enough to stick in the league … Knows how to operate on the block with solid post moves and rebounding ability … Very good feel for the game and can put the ball on the deck in transition or facing up in order to create shots … While slow, he does show some solid 3-man attributes with ball handling, passing and being able to face up and shoot … Helped by today’s NBA shifting to smaller 4s … Despite below average run/jump athleticism, at times he surprises with the occasional ally oop dunk or breakaway dunk in which he displays decent explosiveness, without contact … Hit 172 of 194 FTs in senior year, just a shade under 90%, illustrating what a phenomenal shooter he is … Seemed to put more attention into playing in the post in his senior year. Getting to the line almost 7 times per game … 10 boards per game shows his willingness to play physical and solid strength … Engaged defender who had effiecient numbers playing against bigs in the Horizon League …   ",": Likely to be overwhelmed by NBA athletes. A below average athlete by NBA standards … At 6’8, moves like a center in a small forward’s body … Lack of size at the 4 position (6’8) compounds his athleticism concerns … Very slow laterally and slow to react to plays … He lacks the speed to defend SFs and ideal size and strength to defend in the post … Not especially fast in the open floor. A bit of a plodder. Coming off a season ending injury (stress fracture in his foot) puts draft chances in jeopardy … Level of competition was low playing in the Horizon League … Shot well below expectations as a senior at 36.3% 3p, after hitting 44.0% and 46.6% from 3 as a Junior and Sophomore … Drop in efficiency may be partially due to teams game planning to limit his looks from behind the arch …   ",6-8,235,PF,Valparaiso,Sr.,2017

Johnathan Motley,": An extremely long, rangy big man with a versatile offensive game, Johnathan Motley has made the most of the opportunity as Baylor’s top dog after Taurean Prince has made the transition to the NBA. Measuring 6’9’’ in shoes, Motley sports a massive 7’3.5’’ wingspan and a 9’3’’ standing reach, which are both elite measurements for a power forward. He’s filled out nicely over the yeas as well, and weighs in at a strong 232 pounds (up about 30 lbs since his high school days).  Motley also possesses great end to end speed, and the ability to really get out on the break. Athletically, he’s a quick leaper as well, who can get off the ground nicely. Johnathan has also been able to transition into a number one option at the collegiate level (16.3 ppg). He’s done so by using a solid mid range game (42.5% on jump shots according to Hoop-Math.com) as well as the ability to post up on the block and use a nice hook over either shoulder. Motley’s has a high release on his jumper, and good touch, even on fade aways and turn arounds. He’s also a terrific offensive rebounder and has already tallied 19 put-backs as a part of hauling in 2.9 offensive rebounds per game (through 12-31-2016). He’s also shown a new part of his game this season, and that is passing out of the post. Motley is averaging a career high 2.2 assists per game, and has shown the smarts to make good passes out of double teams, now that he’s a larger focus of Baylor’s offense. Defensively, he’s solid and has shown the ability to move laterally and disrupt the passing lanes in Baylor’s zone defense. While zone is not a common set in the NBA, he has the athletic tools, and awareness to transition into at least a solid defender who can mop up defensive rebounds at a high rate.  ",": Johnathan has a really good mid range game, but in the spacing heavy NBA landscape of today, you’d like your stretch 4 to have 3 point range. His percentage this season is a very good .385%, but it’s on limited attempts (5-13) so it’s difficult to know if that’s an accurate representation of his range. Motley is surprisingly not a high level shot blocker, despite his great length. He blocks just 1 shot per game at Baylor, and while Jo Lual-Acuil acts as the Bears’ primary rim protector, you’d still like to see more swats from a guy sporting a 9’3’’ standing reach. Motley has shown the ability to block 3 or 4 shots in a game, though, so this could be improved upon as the year progresses. He’s also improved his FT shooting this season to a respectable 68%, but you’d like to see him get that over 70%, but I think that is not out of the question when looking at his continued growth. Motley is a red shirt, so he’ll turn 22 at the and of his junior season.  ",6-9,240,PF,Baylor,Jr.,2017
Kadeem Allen,": Allen has an impressive set of physical tools, listed at 6’3 with a filled out 200 pound frame and long arms to make up for his lack of height … He has excellent length for a guard and can definitely match up physically with NBA guards … Allen has demonstrated solid vision with the ball in his hands and has the potential to develop into a good facilitator in the half court … He can make accurate passes on the move with either hand and has done an exemplary job of running the offense for a young Arizona team … He still has room to grow as a distributor in the half court, but he has shown he can create for himself on offense as well … He excels at getting to the rim by utilizing his combination of quickness and strength … He prefers to get to the rim, but he has also improved as a shooter, particularly off the catch since last season … While he is still not a great shooter, he has become more than capable from outside, knocking down over 40% of his threes on the year (low volume: 30-of-72) … Where Allen is particularly appealing to NBA execs is his defensive potential … He boasts an excellent combination of physical tools at the guard position, and he employs his quickness and length well to pressure the ball outside the three-point line … He was one of the best defensive players in college basketball the last two seasons, showing the ability to guard several positions with his lateral quickness, wingspan and strength … Allen is a physical defender who is not afraid to get in his opponent’s chest and force a turnover, as he averaged 1.6 steals per contest this season … His lateral quickness and overall speed is elite … He also rebounds well for a guard, as he pulled down over four rebounds per game this season … Allen has the potential to defend NBA guards right now and his desire to accept that role as a defensive stopper along with his physical tools has placed him firmly on the NBA Draft radar … In addition, with his improvements offensively he could be a strong candidate to be a late steal in the draft …   ",": Allen is a good passer in transition, but he has a tendency to put his head down in half court isolation situations, which limits his vision … He is also a bit turnover prone … He could stand to tighten up his dribble, particularly in traffic, which allows defenders to force turnovers … He needs to improve as a finisher in the paint, which is surprising given his physical tools … He also tries to avoid contact too often once he gets close to the rim which leaves him with some off-balance shots at the rim. On top of that, he doesn’t have great touch on his layups or floaters … While Allen’s shooting has improved, it is still not a great strength for him … He shoots a bit of a line drive, and he’ll need to improve his mechanics at the next level … His senior numbers from the floor were solid but on a low volume so there is some question about how well he can shoot at a higher volume … Already 24 years old, Allen will be one of the oldest players on the draft radar, there will be a lot of questions regarding his upside and if his offensive skills can be refined quickly enough …   ",6-2,190,SG,Arizona,Sr.,2017
Monte Morris,": The undisputed king of collegiate assist to turnover ratio enters the 2017 draft as an extremely experienced and high level floor general … Monte Morris’ ability to play big time minutes, and not turn the ball over is an obvious value at any level … His senior season in Ames he sported a 5.16 A/To ratio, his best at ISU … Morris’ offensive IQ is extremely high, and his ball handling, while not overtly flashy, is also well above average … He’s adept at using screens, penetrating the lane, and executing a fast break to perfection, which are translatable at any level … Monte is also a very good shooter … He’s never shot below .358% on 3s in college, and as a senior, he nailed .378% on 4.1 attempts per contest … He’s also a very good free throw shooter, and has a very good intuition in regards to shot selection … Morris can pull up off the dribble in the mid-range as well, and this again is utilized effectively due to his knowledge of spacing … Athletically, he’s quick and has good end to end speed with or without the ball in his hands … While lean, Morris stands 6’3’’ in shoes, and measures a solid 6’5’’ wingspan … He definitely possesses adequate size to guard the majority of NBA point guards … Monte’s defensive skills include quick hands, and good instinct in the passing lanes … Finishing at the rim was not a problem for him either at the college level … His 65% clip at the rim (according to hoop-math.com) is extremely good for a point guard … Plus, he has some room to fill out in terms of muscle mass … He used this length rather nicely on the glass where he pulled down 4.8 boards per contest, which is good for a point guard …  ",": One pretty obvious weakness for Morris will be his slight 175 pound frame … For him to maximize his NBA potential he’ll need to fill out in order to compete with physical, strong NBA backcourts … He’s also a solid athlete, but at the next level, he’s going to give up athleticism on a nightly basis … He has the IQ to mitigate some of this, but it’s still a deficit … I feel Morris’ main issue in the NBA will be improving his scoring, and/or finding a niche in the NBA … It’s a luxury that he can be so efficient running an offense, but does not screwing up really warrant NBA minutes? Further honing his 3 point shot to become a 40+% shooter would also help his cause, this is very do-able because of his good mechanics … Since he most likely won’t be hanging his hat on the defensive end, he’ll need to up his game … He’ll turn 23 before his first NBA game, so he’ll need to figure out his NBA niche fairly quick or risk teams giving that roster spot to a guy they feel has a higher ceiling …  ",6-2,175,PG,Iowa St.,Sr.,2017

Will he fully recover and how long before he can be expected to be at full strength? … Missed out on Xavier’s tourney run and experience remains a weakness as he played in the Big East, not one of the top conferences to test a PG … Underachieved slightly considering his talent level …  ",6-5,175,PG/SG,Xavier,So.,2017
Charles Cooke,": Great basketball body for a shooting guard, with a 6’11.5 wingspan and 8’7 standing reach … Smooth, fluid athlete as well, and while he may not seem like he jumps out of the gym can play some above the rim … Improved his long-range shooting upon transferring from James Madison to Dayton, was at 108-272 (39.7%) 3PT during his last two college seasons … Was involved in a lot of pick-and-roll action as the ball handler and used it very well going to the basket or freeing himself for shots … Was also quite willing to use his size, length advantage over smaller defenders, plus went to the line over 5 times per game as a senior, which is slightly below what he had done the two years previous … Became much more of a distributor as a senior, with his aggressive style leading to lanes for cutters, made a number of solid reads with a 1.35:1 assist-to-turnover ratio (2.8 apg-2.1 topg) … Not a bad rebounder for a guard, pretty decent nose for the ball and attacks when in his space … Length and speed allow him some recovery ability on defense, will tend to keep with the play even if he gets beat and seems to have tools to work with on that end of the floor … Shows timing and change of speed as a driver, which leads to either open paths for finishes or ability to draw contact … Quick leaper and quick reaction time, which really helps on both sides of court … Uses crossovers, hesitations as a dribbler, even has a runner, floater and hook game near hoop … Very good at challenging shots, even had some surprising timing as a shot blocker … Conditioning looks to be a strong suit logged over 31.6 mpg during his last three seasons in college … Gets low, moves pretty well laterally and he shows good effort on defense, which is even more of a positive sign towards his progression … Transition play is not necessarily a standout quality of his, but he can certainly get out and run, finish on the break … Looks to have a good attitude and intensity behind him, appears to have a level of maturity that should bode well moving forward ",": His touch around the hoop, and even as a jump shooter inside the arc is sort of a reason for concern … Would often force shots or take bad angles, or leave the ball a bit short … Nearly 23-years old and while he definitely showed improvement as a playmaker as a senior, other areas of his game remaining pretty close to the same level, which leads to questions about his offense moving forward … Was not very comfortable shooting off of the bounce, struggled from the short and mid-range as a shooter as well … Can at times gamble and lose focus defensively, be caught off balance on fakes … Did not show much isolation ability and while he can dribble in space and as a handler in the pick-and-roll, his first step is not incredibly explosive and he will have issues getting to the basket … Finished college as a 70.2% FT shooter, which is not really a great indication as far as success from NBA long-range, or in terms of his all-around shooting … Can certainly stand to gain some strength and while he does have a solid frame, NBA guards will be a tough test for him to start … At times could get lost out of the game, when he is guarded to closely can force the issue and make bad plays, take bad shots … Seemed to have his worst games against the best opponents, could struggle going up against higher level competition where he was the focus, including both of Dayton’s first round NCAA Tournament exit games and against ranked opponents … Did not really do much coming off of screens, and even with his physical gifts was not really able to ever get much of a chance to post-up … Was the focal point of Dayton’s offense, and while his ability as a pick-and-roll ball handler should serve well, still a question as to what quality he will bring as a NBA role player … Already 22-years old, will turn 23 shortly after draft, which may limit what some may see as his potential to get much beyond where he is ",6-5,190,SG,Dayton,Sr.,2017

Kobi Simmons,": Simmons is a speedy combo guard that can really score the basketball … This past season at Arizona, he did not often have the opportunity to display his full offensive repertoire in a crowded backcourt … However, Simmons came out of a loaded freshman class, and is one of the best perimeter scorers in the crop … He has a variety of moves once he gets into the paint, where he can finish acrobatically with wither hand … Where he really stands out is that he can really knock down shots off the dribble … He has an excellent pull-up jumper in his arsenal, which is essential in the NBA for a point guard … He does a good job of using screens and moving well without the ball to get himself open looks, but he also excels at creating offense for himself … Simmons additionally has a very quick first step, which means defenders have to give up space to him in order to slow him down off the dribble … This is what makes him difficult to guard, as the defense has to respect his driving ability, but he also complements it well with his perimeter scoring off the dribble … Simmons is not a true point guard, but he has the size to play either backcourt position, whether that be the point man or a scoring 2 guard, at 6-5 with solid length … He is rhythm shooter who has the ability to catch fire at times from the outside. He also does a good job of absorbing contact at the rim and getting to the free throw line, where he does a nice job of converting (77.5% this season) … One of the most appealing aspects of Simmons’ game is that he is a gifted athlete … In his senior year of high school, his vertical leap was measured to be at 42”, and that could increase further as his frame fills out in the next couple of years … His combination of size and elite quickness and athleticism give him intriguing upside as a defensive player … Simmons is already a good on-ball defender, but he has the potential to be a lockdown defensive stopper at the next level if he applies himself and gets stronger, with his ability to guard multiple positions … He also has great instincts as an off-the-ball defender, leading Arizona with nine charges taken this season … There is a lot of upside for Simmons, and he could potentially become an excellent NBA player.  ",": As good as Simmons is with the ball in his hands at creating offense, he isn’t enough of a facilitator … He does not look to pass very often when he gets into the lane, as he is constantly looking for his own shots when he’s on the floor … He is much more of an isolation player at this stage, and he struggles to operate out of the pick-and-roll as a playmaker, which is a vital tool for success in the NBA as a lead guard … Simmons played 23.5 minutes per game at Arizona this past season, but he only averaged two assists per contest, a sign that his playmaking instincts need to improve …  He did not turn the ball over that frequently, coughing it up 1.2 times per game, but he has a tendency to over dribble and play out of control, which leads to bad turnovers … Maturity and attitude are points that scouts note that he must improve upon … His attitude came under fire after Trier returned to the team at midseason and he was visibly unhappy with coming off the bench. His play suffered as he stopped moving the ball as willingly, and Coach Miller was forced to cut his minutes futher … If he wants to make it as a point guard in the association, it is imperative that he improves his decision-making and starts getting his teammates more involved … Inefficiency is also a concern for Simmons right now … He shot just 39.5% from the field in his freshman season, which is largely the result of subpar shot selection … As good as he is off the dribble, he needs to improve his consistency as a spot-up shooter, as he made only 32% of his threes this season … In the NBA, it is so difficult to be a consistent scorer without a reliable jump shot, so this needs to be a priority … Maybe the biggest concern for now is adding strength to his slender frame. He weighs less than 200 pounds, which will be a problem at the next level when matched up with bigger guards in the NBA … However, he is still just 19 years old, so he should develop physically with time … A kid with a very high ""situational dependency"" at the next level for him to reach his potential … Could have used an additional season in college to improve his skill level, however he apparently was always of the mindset that he was a one and done player …  ",6-4,170,PG/SG,Arizona,Fr.,2017
Keita Bates-Diop,": Right away, Bates-Diop’s length and athleticism jump off the page, possessing a 7′ 3.25” wingspan and a 8′ 10.5"" standing reach … This length is critical to defending at the next level and gaining an advantage at the rim on both ends of the floor … His length and versatility he showed in college will help him effectively guard three positions in the pros, while also making him versatile enough to score from at least three positions … He showed he has the speed to put the ball on the deck and blow by defenders to get to the rim … This speed was especially effective in transition and on the fastbreak where he excelled at getting to the rim and facilitating the offense … Bates-Diop wasn’t afraid of physical play, especially at the rim where his rebounding was efficient and one of the best in the Big Ten and his shot blocking is already elite … One of the most underrated aspects of his game was his mid-range post game, where he was very comfortable … Staying four years in college gives Bates-Diop a higher level of maturity and basketball I.Q. that most other younger prospects do not possess … He performed great at a top Big Ten school and top college basketball conference, taking on some of the best talent in the country posting impressive (19.8 points per game, 8.7 rebounds per game, 1.6 blocks and 0.9 steals per game) numbers … ",": His ball handling skills need work and were not fine-tuned at college, especially his first step off the dribble … Right now, he wouldn’t be better than the third or fourth best ball handling or scoring option…It was no secret that he was a streaky shooter in college, frequently being called upon to make big shots but frequently off with the shot…While he does possess length and versatility for the next level, it won’t necessarily set him apart from many of the NBA stars on his protected level…It’s unsure what his usage rate will be in the pros, but it should certainly go down from his 29.4 percent rate at Ohio State, leaving the question of how will he adjust in a more limited role…For all his maturity he gained with four years of college, he is an elder statesman at 22 years old and his ceiling should not be as high as other prospects … Took a long time to realize his potential, and having such a disappointing first three years may impact the way scouts view him. (scored more points as a senior, 672 points, than his previous three seasons combined: 600 points) … He was able to shine in his senior year, but some view that as beating up on younger, less physcially developed talent …  ",6-8,225,SF/PF,Ohio St.,Jr.,2018
Jacob Evans,": What he is best at is his ability on the defensive end … Under Mick Cronin at an elite defensive program at Cincinnati, he averaged 1.3 steals last season and remained one of the top defenders in the American Athletic Conference … One thing that sticks out for Evans is his size and frame for a wing … He stands at 6-6 with a 6-9 wingspan … His size did and will continue to create mismatches with smaller guards … He is very young coming out of college and has lots of time and years left for improvement … That frame and size can help him guard all kinds of guards at the next level and create more versatility … One of the best aspects of his game last season was his awareness and patience on offense … He was very smart with the ball, never forcing bad passes or creating bad turnovers and creating good offensive sets for his team … He pushed the pace well in transition and make plays for himself and teammates in scoring opportunities on fastbreaks … Evans is a good finisher at the rim and under the basket he knows what to do …Overall, his basketball I.Q. is already very high and he knows where to be on both sides of the floor at all times … ",": Evans remained wildly inconsistent all season in all facets … While leading the team in scoring, he has eight games of single digits, raising the questions of effort issues or decreased play under better pressure … He is a big guard, but his rebounding numbers didn’t translate to size, only averaging 4.7 boards per game and never having a game last season of more than eight rebounds … At the next level, his size must become more of a factor … For his young age and room for growth, it also might mean he doesn’t have enough reps or experience in college for the next level … Sometimes, his selflessness on offense was too passive and not taking advantage of the best opportunities… Evans was a good player under the rim, but he needs to get better above the rim and learn to play through contact and be effective … He isn’t going into the pros elite in any aspect … ",6-5,200,SG/SF,Cincinnati,Jr.,2018
Jalen Brunson,": Brunson is one of the most accomplished/successful guards to come out of college basketball in recent memory … This past season as a junior, he won his second national championship, earned AP Player of the Year honors and the Wooden Award … Brunson started 115 games at one of the top college programs in the country in Villanova and is an NBA-ready guard with great maturity and basketball IQ for the point guard spot … He was highly productive in his final season, averaging 18.9 points and 4.6 assists as a junior while shooting 52.1 percent from the field and 40.8 percent from the three-point line … There are very few questions about Brunson’s leadership/ intensity / and pure basketball skills … He is an outstanding leader on the court and makes everyone around him better … Brunson can score at all three levels and be a quality facilitator of the basketball as well … While lacking elite size and explosiveness for an NBA lead guard, Brunson has the skill and craftiness to somewhat make up for it … He has the full arsenal of moves on offense … He is left-handed, which is already more difficult to guard in and of itself because defenders aren’t as used to guarding them … Brunson also moves without the ball very well and cuts with purpose to look for angles where he might be open to catch a pass in open areas … He is excellent at advancing the ball with a sense of urgency to spark the break … He consistently has his head up early in the backcourt and is willing to skip the ball ahead to the open man in transition … Brunson also has a very strong fundamental game on the defensive end … His footwork is very good … He understands how to use his body … He is willing to play with physicality … He anticipates, sees the floor and understands how to play in the team defensive concept … With all of that said, Brunson will still have to prove that he can keep NBA point guards in front of him … He also protects the ball by shielding it with his body and by using his strength … Brunson plays with a steady pace, changes gears and directions very well and creates space by initiating contact, all of which helps when penetrating the defense to score or kick to an open teammate … He has very good court vision and the instincts to see and deliver pinpoint cross-court passes or cunning bounce passes to open cutters … Brunson’s strength and decisiveness allows him to finish effectively around the rim, too, and he makes use of jab-steps and pump-fakes regularly, often times making strong and creative drives to the rim while staying low to the ground before taking off and finishing the play when he’s created the right angle … Brunson is comfortable finishing with either hand and is crafty in transition … He regularly utilizes Euro-steps and other advanced footwork moves while attacking from smart angles to get a high percentage shot off … ",": The defensive end is where the most questions will arise for Brunson … In today’s NBA, most teams prefer to play lineups that are extremely versatile and switchable on the defensive end … It is far too easy for teams to force switches and get the match-ups they want … Brunson could be a liability in this regard if things go poorly … To be even more clear, Brunson projects as a player who can only defend one position, the point guard position, and it is not 100 percent clear that Brunson would be successful defending starting NBA point guards … The fact is that most players Brunson defends, even without getting switched on to wings or bigs, will be both bigger (longer) and faster than Brunson … While Brunson is an unselfish player, he has a tendency to at times over-dribble while probing the defense, which leads to turnovers … If he can develop a more consistent floater and pull-up mid-range jumper it would help to make decision making simpler while opening up angles to the rim while making him a more versatile scorer … The defensive end is where Brunson must make strides to prove to scouts that he hs what it takes to excel in the NBA … Brunson’s lateral quickness, effort, and willingness to contest shots left a lot to be desired, which is concerning considering his relative pedestrian physical tools … When projecting to the next level it’s necessary for Brunson’s stock that he proves to be a capable defender since he’ll have to stay in front of the best playmakers in the world at the NBA level … ",6-2,200,PG,Villanova,Jr.,2018

Off the bounce from beyond the arc, floaters, around the rim, catch and shoot, etc … He especially excels inside the 3-point line, shooting 51.0% … He handles the ball really well and has a solid collection of moves, allowing him to do a variety of things on the court … Has a good feel for the game … Knows when to dish it, when to shoot, etc … While excelling in up-tempo systems, he still displays the patience to make the right play … NBA level athlete … He has the quickness, speed, and jumping ability … Dunks with ease … He has a really quick first step, allowing him to beat opponents off the dribble and get into the lane … Does a good job of making plays and once he’s in the lane … Finishes really well around the basket and in traffic … Not afraid of contact … Finishes strong, frequently using two hands to throw it down … Very alert on both ends of the floor … Very good at getting steals when guys aren’t expecting it and seems to read offenses and defenses very well … Does a good job of cutting to the hole, beating guys on the offensive glass for tip ins, etc … He should be able to run the point guard position at the next level given all of his attributes but also has the potential to play off the ball as a shooting guard as well … True combo guard capable of doing a lot of things on the floor: Score, pass, rebound, defend, etc … His rebounding for the guard spot is probably his biggest strength as well as his active defense.   ",": While possessing the ability to score in a wide variety of ways, he wasn’t the best pure scorer in college … Averaged a modest 8.3 points per game in 27 minutes of action per game … He shot 28.4% from 3-point range and 70.6% from the foul line, so his shooting ability will have to get a lot more consistent if he wants to thrive in the NBA … He is a much better scorer inside the 3-point line than beyond … Will he be able to succeed playing this way when he has to contend with guys who are much bigger and quicker? He’ll definitely need to improve his 3-point shooting and foul shooting in order to reach his full potential … Very right hand dominant … Finishes almost exclusively with his right hand … Needs to improve his finishing ability with his off hand … Has the tendency to either force himself to finish right or go up with two hands … The thing he needs to most focus on is becoming a more consistent shooter and also adding some bulk … 190 pounds is pretty light for an NBA player … Lastly, having missed his sophomore season at USC, he’s a bit of gamble in that it’s unclear how much better he has gotten since his freshman year … If he wants to raise his draft stock, he’s going to have to really ball out in pre-draft workouts and at the combine … ",6-3,195,PG/SG,USC,So.,2018
Rawle Alkins,": Quick first step … Able to beat guys off the dribble … Attacks the rim with confidence … Can finish through contact … Capable of running a fast break … Knows when to dish it off … Not afraid of physicality … Pretty alert on defense … Sticks with his man and does a good job forcing turnovers (1.3 steals per game) … Runs the floor well in transition … Solid scorer in college (13.1 points on 35.9% from 3-point range and 72.4% from the foul line) … Should be able to score in the NBA, especially in transition … At 6’4”, 220 pounds, and a 8’3"" standing reach he has good size for an NBA wing … Thick legs and stocky build give him a solid base and good balance … Should be able to handle the NBA from a physicality standpoint … Moves well without the ball … Rarely stands still and is always eager to make a play … Has a pretty high IQ to go along with a high motor … Wants to make the right play for his team …  ",": His shot is a tad flat … While his shooting numbers were solid in college, he could still fine tune his shot … His ball handling is solid, but not where it needs to be if he wants to be a primary ball handler in the NBA … He would really boost his value if he learned how to facilitate better (2.5 assists) … He tries to facilitate, but winds up committing too many turnovers instead (2.6 turnovers per game) … Needs to take better care of the ball … Tends to get overly eager and force something that isn’t there … Needs to not get trapped in the post with the ball … A bit inconsistent … Scored 24 points at Oregon and 20 points vs. USC while scoring 5 points vs. Stanford, 6 points vs. USC in the Pac-12 Tournament, and 8 points vs. Buffalo in the NCAA Tournament … The fact that he disappeared in some big games is cause for concern … He’ll need to convince teams that he can bring it in the clutch and produce at a reliable and consistent rate … Seemed to lose some of the explosiveness that he displayed in high school … Could stand to improve upon his 8.90% body fat percentage …  ",6-4,220,SG,Arizona,So.,2018
Shake Milton,": Combo guard, Shake Milton, brings a 6′ 6”, 207 pound frame with a massive 7’0.75” wingspan to the table … This size paired with the ability to play point guard give him two position (offensive and defensive) potential at the next level … A creative passer and above average ball handler, Milton can wreak havoc in transition, and excels throwing precise lobs and knowing where his teammates are on the court … Averaging 4.5 assists per game as a junior, Shake acted as SMU’s primary ball handler and distributor … While not necessarily a pure point, this experience has certainly prepped him to line up at the one within rotations in the NBA … Milton is a creative finisher around the rim, who excels at getting in the lane with crossovers and a quick first step … His 5.0 FT attempts per game last season is an above average number and Shake converted at an impressive .85% clip … His shooting beyond the arc is also a calling card when looking at translatable skills … Milton shot over 42% every single season at the college  level, and has the ability to stretch his range to the NBA line … He also hit 4 or more three pointers 8 times during his junior season with the Mustangs. For the first time in his collegiate career, Milton also proved he could be a primary scorer and averaged 18 ppg last season while not letting his efficiency drop too much … Shake shot 45% from the field, and even went for 33 points in a win over Wichita State … A pretty solid rebounder, he pulled down 4.7 per contest, and has the size to hit the glass in the NBA as well … While not the quickest or most explosive player, Milton’s great wingspan and size should make him at least an average defender when looking to the next level … He averaged 1.4 steals and .6 blocks last season, both solid numbers for a guard. ",": Shake lacks top end speed and athleticism many elite guard prospects possess … During the combine, he only sported a 33” max vertical, and his speed and agility drills were middle of the pack at best … These limits may have played a part in his 48.3% FG percentage at the rim last season (hoop-math.com) which is a very poor number for a guard who possesses such great length and size … Finishing at the rim in the NBA is only going to get harder … You’d also like Shake’s assist to TO ratio to be a little higher … While 2.3 TO’s per game isn’t a high number, he only created 4.5 shots per game, which leaves him with a sub 2.0 A/TO ratio … This asserts he’s more of a combo guard than an NBA one … In today’s position-less prone league this is less of an issue, but he certainly has more value as a big point guard, than he does as a shooting guard with some handle … From a shooting standpoint, Milton’s numbers are great, but he release is a little low, and in front of his face … This may give him issues getting shots off against larger, more athletic defenders … Ended his junior season by breaking a bone in his hand … ",6-6,205,PG/SG,SMU,Jr.,2018

Secures nearly everything in his area and rebounds out of his area as well … Good defensive instincts and intensity. Great shot blocker, led the Nike EYBL with 4.1 per game. Can get in the head of opposing players; after blocking their shots, will have them rushing their next shot, altering without even contesting. Closes out on the perimeter quickly and covers a lot of ground. Deflects and intercepts cross court passes when playing off the ball on defense. Pretty good about using his hands on defense, doesn’t pick up many unnecessary fouls or leave his feet too often, usually lets the offensive player make the first move. Doesn’t shy away from contact … Shoots a high percentage within close. Averaged 15.5 points per game and shot 73.4% over the Nike EYBL. Stays in his scoring range, doesn’t drift to the perimeter … ",": Isn’t always involved with the offense and lacks awareness. Still raw in terms of skillset. Doesn’t have a post-game or much of a half-court offense. Lacks technique, simply relies on hustle and his physical advantage at this level. Doesn’t have any go-to moves when contested. Needs work on his free throws, mechanical release, shot 54.3% from the line over the Nike EYBL. Although he didn’t shoot threes on the Nike EYBL, he settled for quick threes for Chalmette … Still learning the game. Lacks a feel and basketball IQ. Has trouble handling some passes … Has much room to add strength to both his upper and lower body, which would help him establish low post position and finishing through contact … Mobile but moves a bit awkward. Looks stiff when he runs and lacks fluidity … Can’t pass on the move, comes to a complete stop after rebounds to make a pass … Doesn’t set many screens. Could be very dangerous in the pick and roll if learned and implemented correctly … A year older than some players in his class … ",7-1,225,C,USA,Fr.,2018

Melvin Frazier,": Rare physical specimen with tremendous length … High level athlete … Hit 12’1.5 on his max vert, the highest of anyone at the 2018 NBA draft combine … Late bloomer at the wing position who showed solid improvement as a perimeter threat and became an impact player for a Tulane Green Wave team that finished 14-17 and 10th in the American Conference … Shot a decent percentage from 3 as a junior at 38.5% on 1.2 makes per game (35-91 overall) … Spot up shooting is an improved aspect of his game … Strong transition player and excels slashing to the basket where he’s able to outclass opponents athletically … Great length and explosive leaping ability … One of the top run/jump athletes available in this year’s draft … Has good defensive potential if he improves upon fundamentals. Staying low, disciplined, not reaching or gambling for steals … Shined at NBA draft combine, with solid showing in the scrimmages and especially in the measurement and athleticism testing portion of event … Did a solid job of improving upon his passing, 2.9 assists per game, up from 1.5 as a sophomore … Shows some ability to operate on the block and post up opponents, which will be useful in exploiting mismatches at the next level … An ally oop threat running the baseline … Viewed as a bit of a project but one with upside left to develop due to his considerable athleticism, despite his age …  ",": Despite turning 22 in August, lacks a great feel for the game … Turnover prone. Passing decisions leave a lot to be desired … Not a strong ISO player … Lacks ball handling ability, which limits his ability to fully utilize his explosiveness … Often gets stripped when attacking the basket. High dribble … Lacks great form on his shot … May struggle to extend 3 point shot to NBA range due to mechanical flaws in his shot … Has a tendency to force bad passes on drives when the defense collapses on him … While his 3 point shot was effective, his volume was low. His career 65% FT shooting leads some skepticism about his ability to be effective behind the arc in the NBA … Shot 38.5% (35-91) as a junior, but 26% (28-106) as a sophomore and 31% (81/260) for his career at Tulane … Considering his physical gifts, his level of competition and minutes (34.4 mpg), one would expect better rebounding numbers from him (5.6 per game) … Lack of ISO and ball handling ability affects his free throw opportunities (2.8 makes per game). Actually shot more FTs and 3 pointers as a sophomore … Level of competition in the American Athletic Conference leaves a lot to be desired, adding skepticism of how Frazier can perform on a regular basis against opponents with similar athleticism … His team’s lack of success (5-13 in conference) also makes it more of a challenge to accurately evaluate him … Must learn to play at a much higher intensity level in order to achieve similar success at the next level …  ",6-6,200,SG/SF,Tulane,Jr.,2018

Brandon McCoy,": Great size for an NBA big (7’1”, 250 pounds). Very athletic and moves well for his size. He seems very comfortable in his own skin. Runs the floor well in transition. Should be able to play in faster, up-tempo systems. Should also really excel in the pick and roll with a good point guard. Good hands, knows how to throw it down with authority. Pretty quick down on the block. Knows how to score inside (16.9 points per game). He’s starting to improve his post moves. He’s shown he can hit the fade away jumper. Can even pop it from 3-point range at the top of the key (33.3% on .3 attempts per game). Did a really good job on the boards (10.3 rebounds per game), especially on the offensive glass (3.1 offensive rebounds per game). Boxes out well. Has really improved his ability to command the ball inside. Pretty alert on defense. Eager to protect the rim (1.8 blocks per game). Did a pretty decent job of defending without fouling while still remaining active inside (2.6 fouls per game). Not a selfish player. Willing to find the open man for the easier shot. Tries to set screens, etc.  ",": Needs to do a better job of finishing in traffic with a hand in his face. Does a good job on the offensive glass, but needs to do a better job converting inside. Tends to rush things a bit. While he’s a willing passer, his fundamentals need to improve (.5 assists & 2.6 turnovers per game). His outside jumper also needs to develop more consistency. He’s improving in this area as is evident by the occasional fade away jumper and 3-pointer, but there’s still a lot of room for improvement. Confidence in his shooting needs to improve. His interior defense is solid, but he struggled to guard stretch bigs out on the perimeter. Will need to improve his ability to guard on the perimeter if he wants to stay on the floor with smaller, quicker big men. The tools are definitely there. Seemed to be much more of an issue of comfort/confidence. ",7-1,250,C,UNLV,Fr.,2018
Jevon Carter,": Two time Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year, Javon Carter brings incredible toughness and a relentless style of play to the table when looking towards the next level … Despite being undersized for an NBA point guard (6’1.5” in shoes) Carter sports a 6’4.5” wingspan and an above average athleticism (including a 36.5” max vertical) to the table which paired with his fearless attitude and style of play will make him a plus defender against the majority of NBA point guards … Jevon ranks 17th All-Time in Division 1 Men’s Basketball with 330 career steals, and he’s not just a gambler in the passing lanes … Carter possesses strong hands and quick reflexes that allow him to strip the ball from opponents at a high rate … In addition, his 4.3 rebounds per game is a good number for a player his size, and due to Bob Huggins’ faced paced system he’s excellent at pushing the ball off misses which will aid him in the NBA … From an offensive standpoint Carter is a combo guard that has successfully converted into a pretty solid primary ball handler and distributor … His 6.6 assists per game ranked 3rd in the Big 12, while only turning the ball over 2.6 times per contest (2.53 A/TO ratio) … He does a great job of penetrating off the dribble and kicking it out to open teammates on the perimeter … Jevon is also a high level outside shooter with NBA 3 point range … He sported a 39% shooting percentage over his last two seasons as a Mountaineer, and proved to be a clutch and capable scorer (17.3 ppg) … His 86% clip at the charity stripe just enforces his quality as an overall shooter as well, and not just a 3 point specialist … He’s a strong player as well, with a wide variety of floaters, flip shots, and ways to finish around the basket that is aided by his high level body control, and upper body strength … A hard working player with a gym rat mentality, and a fearless attitude on the court … Jevon Carter has a lot of leadership qualities that don’t show up on paper, but greatly effect a lot of areas of his overall game …  ",": While Jevon Carter is a fearless player I wouldn’t choose to bet against, length projects to be an issue for him at the next level … Despite a nice wingspan and good leaping ability, his 7’11” standing reach was one of the lowest measured at the NBA combine … His grit and skill as a defender will serve him well in the NBA, but larger NBA points will most certainly be able to shoot over him … Length also bothered him finishing around the rim at the collegiate level … Carter shot 50% at the rim (according to Hoop-Math) his senior season at West Virginia, and converting in the lane will only get harder in the league … Getting his shot off on the perimeter will be harder too, and he’ll have to be more crafty to create more space between himself and a longer defender … Jevon will also turn 23 before his first NBA game giving him the label as a player with limited upside …  ",6-1,195,PG,West Virginia,Sr.,2018
Sviatoslav Mykha...,": Svi Mykhailiuk’s biggest strength when looking towards the NBA is outside shot paired with his large frame for a guard … At 6’7.75” in shoes, Svi shot 44% from deep as a Senior, and especially excelled as a spot up shooter … Mykhailiuk also was very good at running the sidelines in break situations and nailing corner 3 pointers … Svi’s range goes well beyond the NBA 3 point line, and he projects to be a nearly 6’8” shooting guard with a pure outside stroke … He also has the capability of catching fire, as he hit five or more threes on nine different occasions as a senior … While not a flashy ball handler, Svi handles the ball very well for his size, and is a savvy and experienced player when it comes to handling pressure with the ball in his hands (only 1.7 TOpg) … While not much of a distributor his first three seasons, he upped his assists per game to 2.7 as a senior, and showed the ability to make high level passes when drawing extra defensive attention off the drive … A player that has grown up around basketball and has played with the Ukrainian national team as a teenager, Svi has high level intangibles and a solid basketball IQ … A surprising athlete, Mykhailiuk showcased a 37” max vertical at the NBA combine, and a 3.15 3/4 court sprint … In addition, at a well conditioned 214 pounds, it’s clear Svi has added considerable strength during his collegiate career … Defensively his size and leaping ability make him a good shot contester, but his lateral speed and short wingspan hurt his ability as an all round defender … While a 4 year player, Svi will not turn 21 until right before the draft and has improved his points, rebounds, assists, and steals every single season at Kansas … His age paired with his track record of improvement give him considerably more potential as a college senior entering  the draft … He also was seen as a guy that probably would have been a lottery pick, late first at worst had he been allowed to enter the draft at the point when he joined KU at 16 years of age …  ",": Svi’s 6’4.75” wingspan is actually shorter than his height which is a rare occurrence for basketball players looking to be drafted … This paired with his difficulty staying with defenders laterally will leave a lot be desired as an NBA defender … He has two offensive positions offensively (SG/SF) but defensively he may be a little too slow for shooting guards, and lack the length to handle many small forwards … For a player with his size and leaping ability he’s a subpar rebounder who’d rather hang out around the perimeter … As a senior, he averaged 3.3 rebounds per game, and just really isn’t very aggressive when looking to clean up misses … He’s shown the tendency to disappear when his shot isn’t falling … Mykhailiuk started off his senior year on a tear, but kind of settled down later in the year, which was in part due to some really timid offensive games … He won’t be asked to carry a large offensive load in the NBA, but you don’t want your situational shooters to have timid streaks either …  ",6-8,210,SG,Kansas,Sr.,2018

Keenan Evans,": Texas Tech’s main offensive weapon and floor general, Keenan Evans’ ability to put the ball in the bucket is probably his biggest strength when looking to the next level …  As a senior, Evans averaged a team leading 17.6 points per game, and did so rather efficiently on only 11.4 shots per game … His knack to get into the lane and draw contact allowed him really control the pace of the game when needed, as well as capitalize on his excellent free throw shooting acumen … Keenan tallied 6.7 free throw attempts per game (2nd in the Big 12) and converted at an impressive .817% shooting clip … He also showed great creativity in converting buckets in the lane, while drawing contact … His ability to fill it up resulted in 7 games last season in which he scored over 25 points (which also includes a career high 38 against Texas) and when the Red Raiders needed a bucket, Evans was the guy with the ball in his hands … In addition he’s shown the ability to shoot off the dribble, coming off screens, and spotting up in the corner, and he’s especially adept as a mid-range shooter … Despite a significant dip in his 3 point percentage as a senior, he does have that kind of range, and projects to at least be a player you need to respect past the 3 point line … While not a true point guard, Evans does have the ball-handling necessary to handle the ball at the NBA level, and as a ball dominant player in college, he is experienced in breaking presses and handling the ball under pressure … From a defensive standpoint, he’s a solid athlete who easily dunks off two feet (at 6′ 3”) and possesses good end to end and lateral speed … He’s projects to a serviceable defender against NBA point guards, especially since he’ll be shouldering a lesser offensive role at the next level … A player who’s demonstrated a fearless attitude, and one who has a track record of clutch finishes, hard work and a bulldog mentality …  ",": Keenan really is more of a 6’3” shooting guard with good ball handling skills … His position at the NBA level will be a point guard, and while the current style of play in the NBA gives combo guards a better chance of sticking than they did 20 years ago, his passing skills leave something to be desired … Evans averaged just 3.2 assists per contest as a senior, and while his 1.9 TO’s per game as a primary ball handler is a low number, it’s well below the 2.0+ assist to TO ratio ideal for point guard prospects … One thing Keenan can improve upon is the quickness of his release … He has the tendency to cock the ball back and this results in a slower release … Against larger, and longer defenders, he’ll need to improve on this to get off his jump shot … He kind of lacks a stand out skill … There are plenty of 6′ 2”-6′ 4” combo guards who scored at a high level in college, but what is his calling card? … Evans’ ability to find a spot in the NBA will have to be dictated on a team being an ideal fit for his game and personality …   ",6-3,185,PG/SG,Texas Tech,Sr.,2018

Devonte Graham,": 1st Team All-American selection, DeVonte Graham, is perhaps the most experienced college point guard in the draft field this season … A crafty scorer … Possessing a high quality outside jump shot, Graham shot .40% from deep as a senior, and sported three point percentages over 40% for three of his four years at Kansas … Devonte has shown the ability to shoot both off the dribble, and as a spot up shooter … Graham has consistently shown his capability to extend his range out past the NBA line as well … His long range shooting will certainly translate to the current NBA landscape … Graham is also well adept at running the pick, and roll and is excellent at throwing lobs in P/R situations … After playing off the ball much of his first three seasons, Graham showed he could really operate as a point guard during his senior season … His assists rose to 7.2 per contest, while still only turning the ball over 2.8 times per game … Devonte’s ability to control the game while being ball dominant paired with his experience playing next to high volume shooters such as Frank Mason, Josh Jackson, and Wayne Selden makes him a versatile option for an NBA franchise … He’s perfectly adept to helping his teammates shine, but as he showed his senior season, he has the skills to up his game when needed (17.2 ppg in 2017-2018) … At 6’2” and with a seemingly long wingspan for his height, Graham isn’t a large point guard, but he certainly is big enough to be considered solid sized for an NBA one … His defense was often overlooked, but is a heady player on the defensive end who can really make life tough for his opponent … In the NBA, he won’t be asked to carry nearly the offensive load he did at Kansas, and I feel he’ll be a capable NBA defender against the majority of NBA point guards … He tallied 197 steals while at Kansas, and has always been effective in the passing lanes due to his high overall basketball IQ … A competitor, who shows a willingness to challenge teammates to raise their level of play in big moments … Graham is a high quality leader, and individual, who is mature and ready to enter professional basketball from a personal standpoint … ",": Devonte Graham, while possessing decent size and length, is still a little thin for an NBA guard … Listed at 185 pounds, he could stand to add some strength … Athletically he’s average, showing good quickness, and the ability to get off the ground, but he’s not a standout by NBA standards … Could be taken out of games mentally if he gets frustrated … A poor shooting start in games potentially means he will stop looking for shots and instead look to distribute the ball instead … This strategy, while unselfish, often hurt the Jayhawks who at times struggled to find scoring during 2017-18 … Only shot .40% from the floor in his senior season, but this is more due to the massive offensive burden he took on for the Jayhawks … I suspect his shot selection will improve in the professional ranks when he’s not asked to do so much for his team … While showing improvement every season in college, Graham turned 23 years old in February and therefore is likely not to be viewed as a player with much upside left to develop … His age is likely to effect his draft stock …  ",6-1,185,PG,Kansas,Sr.,2018

While undersized from an NBA capacity, playing in such a team defensive system in college helped display a good defensive IQ that will help make up for his slight frame and lack of height … A 6’4.5; wingspan is also a decent measurement for a player barely over 6 feet tall … A plus rebounder for a player with his physical makeup, his 4.8 rpg mark in ACC play was actually up from his non-conference number … ",": The biggest and most obvious knock on Kyle Guy is just a sheer lack of both height, and muscle … At just 168.7 pounds at the combine, he was the lightest player, and would be one of the lightest players in the NBA … He’ll need to gain strength to be able to fight off, and defend NBA guards … Additionally, at 6’0.75 barefoot and 6’2.25 in shoes, he’s very undersized for an NBA shooting guard … This will hinder his effectiveness on both ends of the floor … Even in an era where combo guards are more and more apparent, Guy will need to take his ball handling from above average to good or better in order to find regular minutes on an NBA court … Despite a solid wingspan his 7’11.5 standing reach will make him very easy to shoot over for opposing players … Playing next to Ty Jerome, he didn’t need to act as a facilitator much for the Cavaliers, but improving on his ability to set up others, and acting as more of a facilitator will help his cause at the next level as well … Transitioning to a true combo guard and less of an undersized two has been a good blue print for players similar to him that have made it in the NBA, and Guy would be wise follow suit … ",6-2,170,PG/SG,Virginia,Jr.,2019

Tre Jones,": Tre Jones was the fourth most talked about Duke freshman this season, and also the younger brother of Minnesota Timberwolves guard and Duke national champion, Tyus Jones, so he has an underdog mentality … Plays with a lot of toughness and determination … Jones was arguably the best perimeter defender in college basketball this year … He’s so quick, has great footwork, and can stay in front of guys the whole length of the court … He stays disciplined on the ball, rarely going for head fakes and makes it extremely difficult for opposing guards to get by him … He’s also a very active and intelligent defender off the ball, possessing great anticipation leading to a high steal rate … Offensively, Jones is an unselfish floor general, who runs the offense with great decision-making … He’s so smart with the basketball, turning the ball over about just once per game this past season … He has great vision and is an excellent distributor, resulting in an absurd assist to turnover ratio of almost 6:1 … His quickness allows him to get into the lane almost at will, and he always keeps his head up looking for open cutters/a dump off pass down low to one of his big men … Jones also has all of the intangibles that you want in a player … He’s very unselfish and one of those guys that would be just as happy scoring 25 as he is not even attempting a shot the entire game, as long as he gets the win … His defense, poise, and leadership are all things that are essentially guarantees every game, and are qualities that every team at the next level would love to have in a point guard … ",": The main area of concern with Jones right now is his shooting … He doesn’t shoot very much, and doesn’t shoot it at a high percentage when he does fire away … He hesitates fairly often when he has an open look from outside, which either stems from his release being on the longer side, or just Jones lacking confidence in his shot. Jones is also on the smaller side for an NBA point guard. He has room to fill out his frame as well, and could benefit greatly from putting on weight in preparation for the draft. While he’s listed at 6’2, which is essentially the minimum height you’ll see for guards in today’s NBA, he looks to be a little shorter than that. His measurements at the combine are something to look out for and could potentially impact his stock if he’s not quite as tall as he’s currently listed … Lacks elite size but solid with a 6’4 wingspan and 8′ foot standing reach … ",6-2,185,PG,Duke,So.,2020
Payton Pritchard,": Developed into a star in his senior year at Oregon … Fearless competitor and big game performer at the point guard position … High percentage three-point shooter with limitless range … Excellent shooter in the catch-and-shoot game … Sees the court very well and is an accurate passer… Fearless and an inspirational leader … Efficient scorer at the free throw line … Takes care of the ball well even with his high usage rate … Athletic two-way player who averaged over a steal per game in his career … Dynamic scorer both on the drive and from beyond the arc … Can create his own shot with above average ball-handling, a fluid shooting motion and limitless range … Can play both on ball point guard and off-screen sharpshooter … High motor player who shows up when he is needed … Consistent player who never seems to disappear even on off-shooting nights, finding ways to contribute and help his team win … Shows leadership and mental toughness, a desire to compete and doesn’t get rattled easily … Decent size at the point guard position with a 6’4 wingspan at 6’2 … Proved to be a clutch performer in big games and situations, as he proved against Michigan with his early season stand out performance … ",": Despite high free-throw percentage, he struggles to draw fouls and get to the line … One of the older point guards in the draft … Foot speed limits his defensive ability at the next level to some degree … His shot selection is often inconsistent and sometimes reckless, but this could improve as his usage rate goes down … His ceiling in his first couple years is a quality minute role player … His speed, athleticism, and physical profile (6’2, 195 pounds) could make for a difficult transition to the next level … Could struggle against speedy point guards … Can be a little careless with the ball at times, but seemed to improve with ball security as his college career progressed … ",6-2,195,PG,Oregon,Sr.,2020
Nick Richards,": 6’11.75 center … Good size and length with a 7’3.75 wingspan and 9’0.5 standing reach … Good mobility and athleticism … Explosive and quick off the ground, measured the highest standing vertical at the Nike Hoop Summit at 30 inches … Runs the floor well … Good coordination and fluidity … Shoots a high percentage within close, 58% over the Nike EYBL … Hits 3s in warm up situations with time to set up showing nice potential as a shooter … Solid foundation for a post-game … Good footwork at this stage. Shows a fade away in the post that he uses sparingly right now … Doesn’t force his offense. Passes out of the post. Buys into his role as a big man … Stays within his scoring range, doesn’t step out to the perimeter … Stays ready for a pass when a guard penetrates to dump off to him … Good shot blocker, averaged 2.1 per game over the Nike EYBL … Good rebounder. Gets good lift and secures with two hands … Good stroke from the free throw line … Big frame and strength level … ",": Can be passive at times … Lacks a consistent motor and intensity, “Laid back” … Doesn’t always assert himself … Can drift in and out of the action … Can be more physical … Has trouble finishing with contact or in traffic … Post game is raw … Needs work on his jump hook and lacks consistent touch inside. Is limited to simply catching and finishing most of the time … Lacks awareness and feel for the game. Gets out of position defensively. Struggles defending one on one especially in isolation … Leaves his feet on defense too much … Doesn’t handle double teams well. Tries to put the ball down in traffic. Needs to keep the ball high in the post and after rebounds … Limited face up game. Has much room to expand his range … ",6-11,245,C,Kentucky,Jr.,2020
Ashton Hagans,": True point guard with good size, standing 6-3 with a 6-6 wingspan … Has a knack for getting steals, both on the ball and in the passing lanes … Also adept at sneaking up behind offensive players to poke balls free … A very willing passer who looks to drive and kick to create for teammates … Very quick at getting the ball up court, excelling in transition … While not a reliable shooter, his form is not broken, meaning he could develop into somebody that can hit open jumpers reliably … Is a very team oriented player that values team success and seeing his teammates succeed on the court … Skipped his senior season of high school to enroll at Kentucky, meaning even after a sophomore season there will be plenty of developmental years left … Does a good job of capitalizing off defenders’ mistakes and finding openings to get into the paint … ",": Often unsure or unwilling to look for his own offense, sometimes to the detriment of his team, as opponents will play him only as a passer … Uncertainty on when to shoot can result in him missing looks he should make or forcing a pass that results in a turnover … Very turnover prone, recording three or more turnovers in 18 of 37 games as a freshman … Takes far too many jump shots while standing on the three point … Shoots a low percentage on jump shots, including 27.5% from three … Hasn’t shown the types of handles that will allow him to break down defenders in a one-on-one matchup, will often need help from a screener in that regard … While he is a dominant off-ball defender, he is far from a lockdown defender when matched up on the ball, primarily because he takes risks in order to create turnovers … ",6-3,190,PG,Kentucky,So.,2020
Omer Yurtseven,": Even though his numbers in college don’t necessarily show it, Yurtseven’s biggest strength is his versatility on offense …  He’s a threat to score from virtually anywhere on the floor is extremely talented from 10-18 feet …  He’s got great length and an ability to knock down shots from beyond the arc in addition to his mid-range capabilities … He didn’t shoot very many three’s at the college level but he has shown overseas and in multiple workouts that he can do just that …  He has a smooth stroke and good mechanics on his jumper and is a good rebounder when he wants to be and when he is engaged, particularly on the offensive glass … He already has some pro experience under his belt which will serve him well if he were to be drafted and remain on a roster during his first season … ",": For all of the talk of Yurtseven’s ability to score the basketball, he lacks any true post moves and the ability to provide much as it pertains to post scoring, at least he did at NC State this season …  He’s more of a finesse player as opposed to a guy who is going to bang down low …  He is easily moved off of his spots by most defenders and he doesn’t really get good position down low during post ups … He tends to shy away from most contact on both sides of the ball and was routinely taken advantage of on the defensive glass … After sitting out the first nine games of NC State’s season, Yurtseven looked lost a times on the floor and aside from one or two games, never seemed to get any rhythm going … Athleticism could be a concern for him as well as the next level as he doesn’t grade out with the athleticism of some of his peers (John Collins, Bam Adebayo, Ivan Rabb, Harry Giles, etc) … He struggled at the combine with his lane agility and overall vertical … ",7-0,275,C,Georgetown,Jr.,2020
Markus Howard,": He’s a natural shooter/scorer, who is great at creating in space … Great at probing the pick and roll for scoring opportunities … He leads all players in on of the power 5 conferences in points as the ball handler in pick and rolls … Excellent ability to score off the dribble against mismatches … Has a consistent stroke from the three-point line, shown from his from his 40% average from his 3 years … He has the consistent ability to hit contested shots over defenders … He has limitless range … He possesses excellent one-on-one skills … Has shown the ability to play off the ball, running through screens … He doesn’t need much space to get his shot off … Superb free throw shooter right around the 90% mark throughout his college career so far … He’s shown nice touch, especially with his floater that he uses to score over the length of bigger defenders … He’s great at drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line … Polished ISO game. Has a nice step back that allows him to create separation from defenders … He’s great at attacking teams in transition … Has a very smooth mid-range pullup game … He has increased his scoring consistently from his rookie year to his junior year … He can be an effective three-point shooter either off the dribble or off catch and shoot opportunities … He uses a quick first step to blow by his defenders … Has a great handle that allows him to get wherever he wants to on the court against almost every defender he faces … He has excellent work ethic as noted by his teammates and coach Woj … An extremly explosive scorer who put up 40+ points on numerous occasions in his first two seasons at Marquette …  ",": Lacks ideal size and strength, which will make playing defensive a challenge at the next level … He’ll need to focus on getting stronger core strength … He tends to force up some bad shots during games, some of which was out of necessity as he was called upon to score a lot of points … He overdribbles at times and gets stuck in traffic, which results in turnovers …When his shot is off, he will attempt to shoot himself out of a slump rather than facilitate for his teammates … His small frame makes him a target on switches in the paint … At times he controls the ball to much, leading to stagnant isolations … Needs to improve his fundamental defense … At times he can get lost when he’s not guarding the ball. At the next level that will lead to a ton of easy baskets for the opposing team … One complaint is that he gets too focused on scoring the ball that he doesn’t get his teammates involved. So gaining a better balance will be essential for adapting his game … He switches too easily on screens rather than fighting to get through them … He’ll need to work a lot harder to get the same quality shots at the next level … At 5’11 in shoes, he is undersized to play NBA point guard … He is a streaky jump shooter… He struggled at times to gain separation when teams put bigger perimeter defenders on him … Slight frame inhibits him from being able to consistently finish through contact … Has bad tendencies to shoot the ball early in the clock without anyone else touching the ball … He sometimes overpenetrates, going too fast to the rim and blows layups that he should easily make … Should polish his floater and make it a bigger weapon … Doesn’t shoot many mid range shots for someone with his stroke, which makes him more predicable when trying to score at the next level … ",5-11,175,PG,Marquette,Sr.,2020
Cassius Winston,": Winston is a outstanding college PG who will be wrapping up a legendary career at Michigan State that includes a Final 4, a Big 10 POY award, and the school’s all-time assists record … Winston is a very smart PG with good floor vision, passing skills and an excellent feel for the game … Savvy player, can run an offense and get teammates good shots and put them favorable spots with consistency while also using change of pace and shiftiness to create for himself off the dribble … Decent shooting ability, can hit open shots and shots off the dribble at an adequate or better rate … Has floaters in his arsenal, which will be needed for his style of play and physical attributes … Good pick and roll player, is a threat to kick out to shooters on the perimeter or hit the screener for an open shot to keep the defense on their heels … Generally keeps bad decisions to a minimum…Has matured his offensive game from more of below average scorer and shooter, to a 18 ppg scorer and close to 40% from 3 on 5 attempts/game over the last 2 seasons … Somewhat of an overachieving type, Winston is tough and will play through injuries and gut out performances in crunch time … Is a good FT shooter, someone you can trust with the ball late in ball games … Leadership skills and intangibles are among the best in the 2020 draft class, highly unselfish and by all accounts a good teammate and student athlete … ",": Winston is not physically gifted, standing at an ordinary 6’1 190 lbs without any true NBA-level athleticism to speak of … Not particularly quick or explosive, will have trouble finishing at the rim and playing defense against other PGs in the NBA … Also has a very unathletic looking body type …  For as cerebral as he is, he can be turnover prone and did at times cost his team games by coughing up the ball too much … Has put up pretty good shooting numbers in his college career, but his release is a bit on the slow side and it figures to be easier to defend at the next level … Doesn’t look great in the open court … Wasn’t anything special as an on-ball defender in college, doesn’t really create turnovers or get under the skin of opposing guards the way most undersized guards do … Has to rely on smarts and skill solely to win matchups due to limited physical profile … ",6-1,185,PG,Michigan St.,Sr.,2020
